            <h4>A miktam of David.</h4>
            <p><sup>1</sup> Keep me safe, my God, for in you I take refuge.</p>
            <p><sup>2</sup> I say to the Lord, “You are my Lord; apart from you I have no good thing.”</p>
            <p><sup>3</sup> I say of the holy people who are in the land, “They are the noble ones in whom is all my delight.”</p>
            <p><sup>4</sup> Those who run after other gods will suffer more and more. I will not pour out libations of blood to such gods or take up their names on my lips.</p>
            <p><sup>5</sup> Lord, you alone are my portion and my cup; you make my lot secure.</p>
            <p><sup>6</sup> The boundary lines have fallen for me in pleasant places; surely I have a delightful inheritance.</p>
            <p><sup>7</sup> I will praise the Lord, who counsels me; even at night my heart instructs me.</p>
            <p><sup>8</sup> I keep my eyes always on the Lord. With him at my right hand, I will not be shaken.</p>
            <p><sup>9</sup> Therefore my heart is glad and my tongue rejoices; my body also will rest secure,</p>
            <p><sup>10</sup> because you will not abandon me to the realm of the dead, nor will you let your faithful one see decay.</p>
            <p><sup>11</sup> You make known to me the path of life; you will fill me with joy in your presence, with eternal pleasures at your right hand.</p>
