            <h4>For the director of music. Of David the servant of the Lord.</h4>
            <p><sup>1</sup> I have a message from God in my heart concerning the sinfulness of the wicked: There is no fear of God before their eyes.</p>
            <p><sup>2</sup> In their own eyes they flatter themselves too much to detect or hate their sin.</p>
            <p><sup>3</sup> The words of their mouths are wicked and deceitful; they fail to act wisely or do good.</p>
            <p><sup>4</sup> Even on their beds they plot evil; they commit themselves to a sinful course and do not reject what is wrong.</p>
            <p><sup>5</sup> Your love, Lord, reaches to the heavens, your faithfulness to the skies.</p>
            <p><sup>6</sup> Your righteousness is like the highest mountains, your justice like the great deep. You, Lord, preserve both people and animals.</p>
            <p><sup>7</sup> How priceless is your unfailing love, O God! People take refuge in the shadow of your wings.</p>
            <p><sup>8</sup> They feast on the abundance of your house; you give them drink from your river of delights.</p>
            <p><sup>9</sup> For with you is the fountain of life; in your light we see light.</p>
            <p><sup>10</sup> Continue your love to those who know you, your righteousness to the upright in heart.</p>
            <p><sup>11</sup> May the foot of the proud not come against me, nor the hand of the wicked drive me away.</p>
            <p><sup>12</sup> See how the evildoers lie fallenâ€”thrown down, not able to rise!</p>
