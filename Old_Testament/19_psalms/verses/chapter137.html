            <p><sup>1</sup> By the rivers of Babylon we sat and wept when we remembered Zion.</p>
            <p><sup>2</sup> There on the poplars we hung our harps,</p>
            <p><sup>3</sup> for there our captors asked us for songs, our tormentors demanded songs of joy; they said, “Sing us one of the songs of Zion!”</p>
            <p><sup>4</sup> How can we sing the songs of the Lord while in a foreign land?</p>
            <p><sup>5</sup> If I forget you, Jerusalem, may my right hand forget its skill.</p>
            <p><sup>6</sup> May my tongue cling to the roof of my mouth if I do not remember you, if I do not consider Jerusalem my highest joy.</p>
            <p><sup>7</sup> Remember, Lord, what the Edomites did on the day Jerusalem fell. “Tear it down,” they cried, “tear it down to its foundations!”</p>
            <p><sup>8</sup> Daughter Babylon, doomed to destruction, happy is the one who repays you according to what you have done to us.</p>
            <p><sup>9</sup> Happy is the one who seizes your infants and dashes them against the rocks.</p>
