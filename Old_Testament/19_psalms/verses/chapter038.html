            <h4>A psalm of David. A petition.</h4>
            <p><sup>1</sup> Lord, do not rebuke me in your anger or discipline me in your wrath.</p>
            <p><sup>2</sup> Your arrows have pierced me, and your hand has come down on me.</p>
            <p><sup>3</sup> Because of your wrath there is no health in my body; there is no soundness in my bones because of my sin.</p>
            <p><sup>4</sup> My guilt has overwhelmed me like a burden too heavy to bear.</p>
            <p><sup>5</sup> My wounds fester and are loathsome because of my sinful folly.</p>
            <p><sup>6</sup> I am bowed down and brought very low; all day long I go about mourning.</p>
            <p><sup>7</sup> My back is filled with searing pain; there is no health in my body.</p>
            <p><sup>8</sup> I am feeble and utterly crushed; I groan in anguish of heart.</p>
            <p><sup>9</sup> All my longings lie open before you, Lord; my sighing is not hidden from you.</p>
            <p><sup>10</sup> My heart pounds, my strength fails me; even the light has gone from my eyes.</p>
            <p><sup>11</sup> My friends and companions avoid me because of my wounds; my neighbors stay far away.</p>
            <p><sup>12</sup> Those who want to kill me set their traps, those who would harm me talk of my ruin; all day long they scheme and lie.</p>
            <p><sup>13</sup> I am like the deaf, who cannot hear, like the mute, who cannot speak;</p>
            <p><sup>14</sup> I have become like one who does not hear, whose mouth can offer no reply.</p>
            <p><sup>15</sup> Lord, I wait for you; you will answer, Lord my God.</p>
            <p><sup>16</sup> For I said, "Do not let them gloat or exalt themselves over me when my feet slip."</p>
            <p><sup>17</sup> For I am about to fall, and my pain is ever with me.</p>
            <p><sup>18</sup> I confess my iniquity; I am troubled by my sin.</p>
            <p><sup>19</sup> Many have become my enemies without cause; those who hate me without reason are numerous.</p>
            <p><sup>20</sup> Those who repay my good with evil lodge accusations against me, though I seek only to do what is good.</p>
            <p><sup>21</sup> Lord, do not forsake me; do not be far from me, my God.</p>
            <p><sup>22</sup> Come quickly to help me, my Lord and my Savior.</p>
