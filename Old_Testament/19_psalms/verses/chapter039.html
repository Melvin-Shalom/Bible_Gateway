            <h4>A psalm of David. For the director of music. For Jeduthun. A petition.</h4>
            <p><sup>1</sup> I said, “I will watch my ways and keep my tongue from sin; I will put a muzzle on my mouth while in the presence of the wicked.”</p>
            <p><sup>2</sup> So I remained utterly silent, not even saying anything good. But my anguish increased;</p>
            <p><sup>3</sup> my heart grew hot within me. While I meditated, the fire burned; then I spoke with my tongue:</p>
            <p><sup>4</sup> “Show me, Lord, my life’s end and the number of my days; let me know how fleeting my life is.</p>
            <p><sup>5</sup> You have made my days a mere handbreadth; the span of my years is as nothing before you. Everyone is but a breath, even those who seem secure.</p>
            <p><sup>6</sup> “Surely everyone goes around like a mere phantom; in vain they rush about, heaping up wealth without knowing whose it will finally be.</p>
            <p><sup>7</sup> “But now, Lord, what do I look for? My hope is in you.</p>
            <p><sup>8</sup> Save me from all my transgressions; do not make me the scorn of fools.</p>
            <p><sup>9</sup> I was silent; I would not open my mouth, for you are the one who has done this.</p>
            <p><sup>10</sup> Remove your scourge from me; I am overcome by the blow of your hand.</p>
            <p><sup>11</sup> When you rebuke and discipline anyone for their sin, you consume their wealth like a moth— surely everyone is but a breath.</p>
            <p><sup>12</sup> “Hear my prayer, Lord, listen to my cry for help; do not be deaf to my weeping. I dwell with you as a foreigner, a stranger, as all my ancestors were.</p>
            <p><sup>13</sup> Look away from me, that I may enjoy life again before I depart and am no more.”</p>
