            <p><sup>1</sup> Blessed is the one who does not walk in step with the wicked or stand in the way that sinners take or sit in the company of mockers,</p>
            <p><sup>2</sup> but whose delight is in the law of the Lord, and who meditates on his law day and night.</p>
            <p><sup>3</sup> That person is like a tree planted by streams of water, which yields its fruit in season and whose leaf does not witherâ€”whatever they do prospers.</p>
            <p><sup>4</sup> Not so the wicked! They are like chaff that the wind blows away.</p>
            <p><sup>5</sup> Therefore the wicked will not stand in the judgment, nor sinners in the assembly of the righteous.</p>
            <p><sup>6</sup> For the Lord watches over the way of the righteous, but the way of the wicked leads to destruction.</p>
