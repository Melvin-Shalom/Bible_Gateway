            <h4>A maskil of Asaph.</h4>
            <p><sup>1</sup> My people, hear my teaching; listen to the words of my mouth.</p>
            <p><sup>2</sup> I will open my mouth with a parable; I will utter hidden things, things from of old—</p>
            <p><sup>3</sup> what we have heard and known, what our ancestors have told us.</p>
            <p><sup>4</sup> We will not hide them from their descendants; we will tell the next generation the praiseworthy deeds of the Lord, his power, and the wonders he has done.</p>
            <p><sup>5</sup> He decreed statutes for Jacob and established the law in Israel, which he commanded our ancestors to teach their children,</p>
            <p><sup>6</sup> so the next generation would know them, even the children yet to be born, and they in turn would tell their children.</p>
            <p><sup>7</sup> Then they would put their trust in God and would not forget his deeds but would keep his commands.</p>
            <p><sup>8</sup> They would not be like their ancestors—a stubborn and rebellious generation, whose hearts were not loyal to God, whose spirits were not faithful to him.</p>
            <p><sup>9</sup> The men of Ephraim, though armed with bows, turned back on the day of battle;</p>
            <p><sup>10</sup> they did not keep God’s covenant and refused to live by his law.</p>
            <p><sup>11</sup> They forgot what he had done, the wonders he had shown them.</p>
            <p><sup>12</sup> He did miracles in the sight of their ancestors in the land of Egypt, in the region of Zoan.</p>
            <p><sup>13</sup> He divided the sea and led them through; he made the waters stand up like a wall.</p>
            <p><sup>14</sup> He guided them with the cloud by day and with light from the fire all night.</p>
            <p><sup>15</sup> He split the rocks in the wilderness and gave them water as abundant as the seas;</p>
            <p><sup>16</sup> he brought streams out of a rocky crag and made water flow down like rivers.</p>
            <p><sup>17</sup> But they continued to sin against him, rebelling in the wilderness against the Most High.</p>
            <p><sup>18</sup> They willfully put God to the test by demanding the food they craved.</p>
            <p><sup>19</sup> They spoke against God; they said, “Can God really spread a table in the wilderness?</p>
            <p><sup>20</sup> True, he struck the rock, and water gushed out, streams flowed abundantly. But can he also give us bread? Can he supply meat for his people?”</p>
            <p><sup>21</sup> When the Lord heard them, he was furious; his fire broke out against Jacob, and his wrath rose against Israel.</p>
            <p><sup>22</sup> For they did not believe in God or trust in his deliverance.</p>
            <p><sup>23</sup> Yet he gave a command to the skies above and opened the doors of the heavens;</p>
            <p><sup>24</sup> he rained down manna for the people to eat, he gave them the grain of heaven.</p>
            <p><sup>25</sup> Human beings ate the bread of angels; he sent them all the food they could eat.</p>
            <p><sup>26</sup> He let loose the east wind from the heavens and by his power made the south wind blow.</p>
            <p><sup>27</sup> He rained meat down on them like dust, birds like sand on the seashore.</p>
            <p><sup>28</sup> He made them come down inside their camp, all around their tents.</p>
            <p><sup>29</sup> They ate till they were gorged—he had given them what they craved.</p>
            <p><sup>30</sup> But before they turned from what they craved, even while the food was still in their mouths,</p>
            <p><sup>31</sup> God’s anger rose against them; he put to death the sturdiest among them, cutting down the young men of Israel.</p>
            <p><sup>32</sup> In spite of all this, they kept on sinning; in spite of his wonders, they did not believe.</p>
            <p><sup>33</sup> So he ended their days in futility and their years in terror.</p>
            <p><sup>34</sup> Whenever God slew them, they would seek him; they eagerly turned to him again.</p>
            <p><sup>35</sup> They remembered that God was their Rock, that God Most High was their Redeemer.</p>
            <p><sup>36</sup> But then they would flatter him with their mouths, lying to him with their tongues;</p>
            <p><sup>37</sup> their hearts were not loyal to him, they were not faithful to his covenant.</p>
            <p><sup>38</sup> Yet he was merciful; he forgave their iniquities and did not destroy them. Time after time he restrained his anger and did not stir up his full wrath.</p>
            <p><sup>39</sup> He remembered that they were but flesh, a passing breeze that does not return.</p>
            <p><sup>40</sup> How often they rebelled against him in the wilderness and grieved him in the wasteland!</p>
            <p><sup>41</sup> Again and again they put God to the test; they vexed the Holy One of Israel.</p>
            <p><sup>42</sup> They did not remember his power—the day he redeemed them from the oppressor,</p>
            <p><sup>43</sup> the day he displayed his signs in Egypt, his wonders in the region of Zoan.</p>
            <p><sup>44</sup> He turned their rivers to blood; they could not drink from their streams.</p>
            <p><sup>45</sup> He sent swarms of flies that devoured them, and frogs that devastated them.</p>
            <p><sup>46</sup> He gave their crops to the grasshopper, their produce to the locust.</p>
            <p><sup>47</sup> He destroyed their vines with hail and their sycamore-figs with sleet.</p>
            <p><sup>48</sup> He gave over their cattle to the hail, their livestock to bolts of lightning.</p>
            <p><sup>49</sup> He unleashed against them his hot anger, his wrath, indignation and hostility— a band of destroying angels.</p>
            <p><sup>50</sup> He prepared a path for his anger; he did not spare them from death but gave them over to the plague.</p>
            <p><sup>51</sup> He struck down all the firstborn of Egypt, the firstfruits of manhood in the tents of Ham.</p>
            <p><sup>52</sup> But he brought his people out like a flock; he led them like sheep through the wilderness.</p>
            <p><sup>53</sup> He guided them safely, so they were unafraid; but the sea engulfed their enemies.</p>
            <p><sup>54</sup> And so he brought them to the border of his holy land, to the hill country his right hand had taken.</p>
            <p><sup>55</sup> He drove out nations before them and allotted their lands to them as an inheritance; he settled the tribes of Israel in their homes.</p>
            <p><sup>56</sup> But they put God to the test and rebelled against the Most High; they did not keep his statutes.</p>
            <p><sup>57</sup> Like their ancestors they were disloyal and faithless, as unreliable as a faulty bow.</p>
            <p><sup>58</sup> They angered him with their high places; they aroused his jealousy with their idols.</p>
            <p><sup>59</sup> When God heard them, he was furious; he rejected Israel completely.</p>
            <p><sup>60</sup> He abandoned the tabernacle of Shiloh, the tent he had set up among humans.</p>
            <p><sup>61</sup> He sent the ark of his might into captivity, his splendor into the hands of the enemy.</p>
            <p><sup>62</sup> He gave his people over to the sword; he was furious with his inheritance.</p>
            <p><sup>63</sup> Fire consumed their young men, and their young women had no wedding songs;</p>
            <p><sup>64</sup> their priests were put to the sword, and their widows could not weep.</p>
            <p><sup>65</sup> Then the Lord awoke as from sleep, as a warrior wakes from the stupor of wine.</p>
            <p><sup>66</sup> He beat back his enemies; he put them to everlasting shame.</p>
            <p><sup>67</sup> Then he rejected Joseph, the tribe of Ephraim;</p>
            <p><sup>68</sup> but he chose the tribe of Judah, Mount Zion, which he loved.</p>
            <p><sup>69</sup> He built his sanctuary like the heights, like the earth that he established forever.</p>
            <p><sup>70</sup> He chose David his servant and took him from the sheep pens;</p>
            <p><sup>71</sup> from tending the sheep he brought him to be the shepherd of his people Jacob, of Israel his inheritance.</p>
            <p><sup>72</sup> And David shepherded them with integrity of heart; with skillful hands he led them.</p>
