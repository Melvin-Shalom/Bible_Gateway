            <h4>For the director of music. To the tune of “The Death of the Son.” A psalm of David.</h4>
            <p><sup>1</sup> I will give thanks to you, Lord, with all my heart; I will tell of all your wonderful deeds.</p>
            <p><sup>2</sup> I will be glad and rejoice in you; I will sing the praises of your name, O Most High.</p>
            <p><sup>3</sup> My enemies turn back; they stumble and perish before you.</p>
            <p><sup>4</sup> For you have upheld my right and my cause, sitting enthroned as the righteous judge.</p>
            <p><sup>5</sup> You have rebuked the nations and destroyed the wicked; you have blotted out their name for ever and ever.</p>
            <p><sup>6</sup> Endless ruin has overtaken my enemies, you have uprooted their cities; even the memory of them has perished.</p>
            <p><sup>7</sup> The Lord reigns forever; he has established his throne for judgment.</p>
            <p><sup>8</sup> He rules the world in righteousness and judges the peoples with equity.</p>
            <p><sup>9</sup> The Lord is a refuge for the oppressed, a stronghold in times of trouble.</p>
            <p><sup>10</sup> Those who know your name trust in you, for you, Lord, have never forsaken those who seek you.</p>
            <p><sup>11</sup> Sing the praises of the Lord, enthroned in Zion; proclaim among the nations what he has done.</p>
            <p><sup>12</sup> For he who avenges blood remembers; he does not ignore the cries of the afflicted.</p>
            <p><sup>13</sup> Lord, see how my enemies persecute me! Have mercy and lift me up from the gates of death,</p>
            <p><sup>14</sup> that I may declare your praises in the gates of Daughter Zion, and there rejoice in your salvation.</p>
            <p><sup>15</sup> The nations have fallen into the pit they have dug; their feet are caught in the net they have hidden.</p>
            <p><sup>16</sup> The Lord is known by his acts of justice; the wicked are ensnared by the work of their hands.</p>
            <p><sup>17</sup> The wicked go down to the realm of the dead, all the nations that forget God.</p>
            <p><sup>18</sup> But God will never forget the needy; the hope of the afflicted will never perish.</p>
            <p><sup>19</sup> Arise, Lord, do not let mortals triumph; let the nations be judged in your presence.</p>
            <p><sup>20</sup> Strike them with terror, Lord; let the nations know they are only mortal.</p>
