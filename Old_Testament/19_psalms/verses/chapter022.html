            <h4>For the director of music. To the tune of “The Doe of the Morning.” A psalm of David.</h4>
            <p><sup>1</sup> My God, my God, why have you forsaken me? Why are you so far from saving me, so far from my cries of anguish?</p>
            <p><sup>2</sup> My God, I cry out by day, but you do not answer, by night, but I find no rest.</p>
            <p><sup>3</sup> Yet you are enthroned as the Holy One; you are the one Israel praises.</p>
            <p><sup>4</sup> In you our ancestors put their trust; they trusted and you delivered them.</p>
            <p><sup>5</sup> To you they cried out and were saved; in you they trusted and were not put to shame.</p>
            <p><sup>6</sup> But I am a worm and not a man, scorned by everyone, despised by the people.</p>
            <p><sup>7</sup> All who see me mock me; they hurl insults, shaking their heads.</p>
            <p><sup>8</sup> “He trusts in the Lord,” they say, “let the Lord rescue him. Let him deliver him, since he delights in him.”</p>
            <p><sup>9</sup> Yet you brought me out of the womb; you made me trust in you, even at my mother’s breast.</p>
            <p><sup>10</sup> From birth I was cast on you; from my mother’s womb you have been my God.</p>
            <p><sup>11</sup> Do not be far from me, for trouble is near and there is no one to help.</p>
