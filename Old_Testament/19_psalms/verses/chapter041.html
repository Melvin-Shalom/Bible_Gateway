            <h4>A psalm of David. A petition.</h4>
            <p><sup>1</sup> Blessed are those who have regard for the weak; the Lord delivers them in times of trouble.</p>
            <p><sup>2</sup> The Lord protects and preserves them— they are counted among the blessed in the land— he does not give them over to the desire of their foes.</p>
            <p><sup>3</sup> The Lord sustains them on their sickbed and restores them from their bed of illness.</p>
            <p><sup>4</sup> I said, “Have mercy on me, Lord; heal me, for I have sinned against you.”</p>
            <p><sup>5</sup> My enemies say of me in malice, “When will he die and his name perish?”</p>
            <p><sup>6</sup> When one of them comes to see me, he speaks falsely, while his heart gathers slander; then he goes out and spreads it around.</p>
            <p><sup>7</sup> All my enemies whisper together against me; they imagine the worst for me, saying,</p>
            <p><sup>8</sup> “A vile disease has afflicted him; he will never get up from the place where he lies.”</p>
            <p><sup>9</sup> Even my close friend, someone I trusted, one who shared my bread, has turned against me.</p>
            <p><sup>10</sup> But may you have mercy on me, Lord; raise me up, that I may repay them.</p>
            <p><sup>11</sup> I know that you are pleased with me, for my enemy does not triumph over me.</p>
            <p><sup>12</sup> Because of my integrity you uphold me and set me in your presence forever.</p>
            <p><sup>13</sup> Praise be to the Lord, the God of Israel, from everlasting to everlasting. Amen and Amen.</p>
