            <h4>For the director of music. A psalm of David. A song.</h4>
            <p><sup>1</sup> Praise awaits you, our God, in Zion; to you our vows will be fulfilled.</p>
            <p><sup>2</sup> You who answer prayer, to you all people will come.</p>
            <p><sup>3</sup> When we were overwhelmed by sins, you forgave our transgressions.</p>
            <p><sup>4</sup> Blessed are those you choose and bring near to live in your courts! We are filled with the good things of your house, of your holy temple.</p>
            <p><sup>5</sup> You answer us with awesome and righteous deeds, God our Savior, the hope of all the ends of the earth and of the farthest seas.</p>
            <p><sup>6</sup> Who formed the mountains by your power, having armed yourself with strength,<p>
            <p><sup>7</sup> who stilled the roaring of the seas, the roaring of their waves, and the turmoil of the nations.</p>
            <p><sup>8</sup> The whole earth is filled with awe at your wonders; where morning dawns, where evening fades, you call forth songs of joy.</p>
            <p><sup>9</sup> You care for the land and water it; you enrich it abundantly. The streams of God are filled with water to provide the people with grain, for so you have ordained it.</p>
            <p><sup>10</sup> Drenching its furrows and leveling its ridges, you soften it with showers and bless its crops.</p>
            <p><sup>11</sup> You crown the year with your bounty, and your carts overflow with abundance.</p>
            <p><sup>12</sup> The grasslands of the wilderness overflow; the hills are clothed with gladness.</p>
            <p><sup>13</sup> The meadows are covered with flocks and the valleys are mantled with grain; they shout for joy and sing.</p>
