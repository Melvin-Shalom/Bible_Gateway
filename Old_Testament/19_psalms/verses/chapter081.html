            <h4>For the director of music. According to gittith. Of Asaph.</h4>
            <p><sup>1</sup> Sing for joy to God our strength; shout aloud to the God of Jacob!</p>
            <p><sup>2</sup> Begin the music, strike the timbrel, play the melodious harp and lyre.</p>
            <p><sup>3</sup> Sound the ram’s horn at the New Moon, and when the moon is full, on the day of our festival;</p>
            <p><sup>4</sup> this is a decree for Israel, an ordinance of the God of Jacob.</p>
            <p><sup>5</sup> When God went out against Egypt, he established it as a statute for Joseph.</p>
            <p><sup>6</sup> I heard an unknown voice say: “I removed the burden from their shoulders; their hands were set free from the basket.</p>
            <p><sup>7</sup> In your distress you called and I rescued you; I answered you out of a thundercloud; I tested you at the waters of Meribah.</p>
            <p><sup>8</sup> Hear me, my people, and I will warn you—if you would only listen to me, Israel!</p>
            <p><sup>9</sup> You shall have no foreign god among you; you shall not worship any god other than me.</p>
            <p><sup>10</sup> I am the Lord your God, who brought you up out of Egypt. Open wide your mouth and I will fill it.</p>
            <p><sup>11</sup> “But my people would not listen to me; Israel would not submit to me.</p>
            <p><sup>12</sup> So I gave them over to their stubborn hearts to follow their own devices.</p>
            <p><sup>13</sup> “If my people would only listen to me, if Israel would only follow my ways,</p>
            <p><sup>14</sup> how quickly I would subdue their enemies and turn my hand against their foes!</p>
            <p><sup>15</sup> Those who hate the Lord would cringe before him, and their punishment would last forever.</p>
            <p><sup>16</sup> But you would be fed with the finest of wheat; with honey from the rock I would satisfy you.”</p>
