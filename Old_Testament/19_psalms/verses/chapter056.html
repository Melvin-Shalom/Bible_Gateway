            <h4>For the director of music. To the tune of “A Dove on Distant Oaks.” Of David. A miktam. When the Philistines had seized him in Gath.</h4>
            <p><sup>1</sup> Be merciful to me, my God, for my enemies are in hot pursuit; all day long they press their attack.</p>
            <p><sup>2</sup> My adversaries pursue me all day long; in their pride many are attacking me.</p>
            <p><sup>3</sup> When I am afraid, I put my trust in you.</p>
            <p><sup>4</sup> In God, whose word I praise—in God I trust and am not afraid. What can mere mortals do to me?</p>
            <p><sup>5</sup> All day long they twist my words; all their schemes are for my ruin.</p>
            <p><sup>6</sup> They conspire, they lurk, they watch my steps, hoping to take my life.</p>
            <p><sup>7</sup> Because of their wickedness do not let them escape; in your anger, God, bring the nations down.</p>
            <p><sup>8</sup> Record my misery; list my tears on your scroll—are they not in your record?</p>
            <p><sup>9</sup> Then my enemies will turn back when I call for help. By this I will know that God is for me.</p>
            <p><sup>10</sup> In God, whose word I praise, in the Lord, whose word I praise—</p>
            <p><sup>11</sup> in God I trust and am not afraid. What can man do to me?</p>
            <p><sup>12</sup> I am under vows to you, my God; I will present my thank offerings to you.</p>
            <p><sup>13</sup> For you have delivered me from death and my feet from stumbling, that I may walk before God in the light of life.</p>
