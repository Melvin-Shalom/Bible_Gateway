            <h4>For the director of music. With stringed instruments. Of David.</h4>
            <p><sup>1</sup> Hear my cry, O God; listen to my prayer.</p>
            <p><sup>2</sup> From the ends of the earth I call to you, I call as my heart grows faint; lead me to the rock that is higher than I.</p>
            <p><sup>3</sup> For you have been my refuge, a strong tower against the foe.</p>
            <p><sup>4</sup> I long to dwell in your tent forever and take refuge in the shelter of your wings.</p>
            <p><sup>5</sup> For you, God, have heard my vows; you have given me the heritage of those who fear your name.</p>
            <p><sup>6</sup> Increase the days of the king’s life, his years for many generations.</p>
            <p><sup>7</sup> May he be enthroned in God’s presence forever; appoint your love and faithfulness to protect him.</p>
            <p><sup>8</sup> Then I will ever sing in praise of your name and fulfill my vows day after day.</p>
