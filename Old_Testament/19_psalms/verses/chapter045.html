            <h4>For the director of music. To the tune of “Lilies.” Of the Sons of Korah. A maskil. A wedding song.</h4>
            <p><sup>1</sup> My heart is stirred by a noble theme as I recite my verses for the king; my tongue is the pen of a skillful writer.</p>
            <p><sup>2</sup> You are the most excellent of men and your lips have been anointed with grace, since God has blessed you forever.</p>
            <p><sup>3</sup> Gird your sword on your side, you mighty one; clothe yourself with splendor and majesty.</p>
            <p><sup>4</sup> In your majesty ride forth victoriously in the cause of truth, humility, and justice; let your right hand achieve awesome deeds.</p>
            <p><sup>5</sup> Let your sharp arrows pierce the hearts of the king’s enemies; let the nations fall beneath your feet.</p>
            <p><sup>6</sup> Your throne, O God, will last for ever and ever; a scepter of justice will be the scepter of your kingdom.</p>
            <p><sup>7</sup> You love righteousness and hate wickedness; therefore God, your God, has set you above your companions by anointing you with the oil of joy.</p>
            <p><sup>8</sup> All your robes are fragrant with myrrh and aloes and cassia; from palaces adorned with ivory the music of the strings makes you glad.</p>
            <p><sup>9</sup> Daughters of kings are among your honored women; at your right hand is the royal bride in gold of Ophir.</p>
            <p><sup>10</sup> Listen, daughter, and pay careful attention: Forget your people and your father’s house.</p>
            <p><sup>11</sup> Let the king be enthralled by your beauty; honor him, for he is your lord.</p>
            <p><sup>12</sup> The city of Tyre will come with a gift, people of wealth will seek your favor.</p>
            <p><sup>13</sup> All glorious is the princess within her chamber; her gown is woven with gold.</p>
            <p><sup>14</sup> In embroidered garments she is led to the king; her virgin companions follow her and are brought to you.</p>
            <p><sup>15</sup> They are led in with joy and gladness; they enter the palace of the king.</p>
            <p><sup>16</sup> Your sons will take the place of your fathers; you will make them princes throughout the land.</p>
            <p><sup>17</sup> I will perpetuate your memory through all generations; therefore the nations will praise you for ever and ever.</p>
