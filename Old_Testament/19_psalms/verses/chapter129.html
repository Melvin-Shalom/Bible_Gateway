            <h4>A song of ascents.</h4>
            <p><sup>1</sup> “They have greatly oppressed me from my youth,” let Israel say;</p>
            <p><sup>2</sup> “they have greatly oppressed me from my youth, but they have not gained the victory over me.</p>
            <p><sup>3</sup> Plowmen have plowed my back and made their furrows long.</p>
            <p><sup>4</sup> But the Lord is righteous; he has cut me free from the cords of the wicked.”</p>
            <p><sup>5</sup> May all who hate Zion be turned back in shame.</p>
            <p><sup>6</sup> May they be like grass on the roof, which withers before it can grow;</p>
            <p><sup>7</sup> a reaper cannot fill his hands with it, nor one who gathers fill his arms.</p>
            <p><sup>8</sup> May those who pass by not say to them, “The blessing of the Lord be on you; we bless you in the name of the Lord.”</p>
