            <h4>A maskil of Asaph.</h4>
            <p><sup>1</sup> O God, why have you rejected us forever? Why does your anger smolder against the sheep of your pasture?</p>
            <p><sup>2</sup> Remember the nation you purchased long ago, the people of your inheritance, whom you redeemed—Mount Zion, where you dwelt.</p>
            <p><sup>3</sup> Turn your steps toward these everlasting ruins, all this destruction the enemy has brought on the sanctuary.</p>
            <p><sup>4</sup> Your foes roared in the place where you met with us; they set up their standards as signs.</p>
            <p><sup>5</sup> They behaved like men wielding axes to cut through a thicket of trees.</p>
            <p><sup>6</sup> They smashed all the carved paneling with their axes and hatchets.</p>
            <p><sup>7</sup> They burned your sanctuary to the ground; they defiled the dwelling place of your Name.</p>
            <p><sup>8</sup> They said in their hearts, “We will crush them completely!” They burned every place where God was worshiped in the land.</p>
            <p><sup>9</sup> We are given no signs from God; no prophets are left, and none of us knows how long this will be.</p>
            <p><sup>10</sup> How long will the enemy mock you, God? Will the foe revile your name forever?</p>
            <p><sup>11</sup> Why do you hold back your hand, your right hand? Take it from the folds of your garment and destroy them!</p>
            <p><sup>12</sup> But God is my King from long ago; he brings salvation on the earth.</p>
            <p><sup>13</sup> It was you who split open the sea by your power; you broke the heads of the monster in the waters.</p>
            <p><sup>14</sup> It was you who crushed the heads of Leviathan and gave it as food to the creatures of the desert.</p>
            <p><sup>15</sup> It was you who opened up springs and streams; you dried up the ever-flowing rivers.</p>
            <p><sup>16</sup> The day is yours, and yours also the night; you established the sun and moon.</p>
            <p><sup>17</sup> It was you who set all the boundaries of the earth; you made summer and winter.</p>
            <p><sup>18</sup> Remember how the enemy has mocked you, Lord, how foolish people have reviled your name.</p>
            <p><sup>19</sup> Do not hand over the life of your dove to wild beasts; do not forget the lives of your afflicted people forever.</p>
            <p><sup>20</sup> Have regard for your covenant, because haunts of violence fill the dark places of the land.</p>
            <p><sup>21</sup> Do not let the oppressed retreat in disgrace; may the poor and needy praise your name.</p>
            <p><sup>22</sup> Arise, O God, and defend your cause; remember how fools mock you all day long.</p>
            <p><sup>23</sup> Do not ignore the clamor of your adversaries, the uproar of your enemies, which rises continually.</p>
