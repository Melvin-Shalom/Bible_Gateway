            <h4>Of David. A psalm.</h4>
            <p><sup>1</sup> The Lord says to my lord: “Sit at my right hand until I make your enemies a footstool for your feet.”</p>
            <p><sup>2</sup> The Lord will extend your mighty scepter from Zion, saying, “Rule in the midst of your enemies!”</p>
            <p><sup>3</sup> Your troops will be willing on your day of battle. Arrayed in holy splendor, your young men will come to you like dew from the morning’s womb.</p>
            <p><sup>4</sup> The Lord has sworn and will not change his mind: “You are a priest forever, in the order of Melchizedek.”</p>
            <p><sup>5</sup> The Lord is at your right hand; he will crush kings on the day of his wrath.</p>
            <p><sup>6</sup> He will judge the nations, heaping up the dead and crushing the rulers of the whole earth.</p>
            <p><sup>7</sup> He will drink from a brook along the way, and so he will lift his head high.</p>
