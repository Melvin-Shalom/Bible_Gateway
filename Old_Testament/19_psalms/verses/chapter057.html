            <h4>For the director of music. To the tune of “Do Not Destroy.” Of David. A miktam. When he had fled from Saul into the cave.</h4>
            <p><sup>1</sup> Have mercy on me, my God, have mercy on me, for in you I take refuge. I will take refuge in the shadow of your wings until the disaster has passed.</p>
            <p><sup>2</sup> I cry out to God Most High, to God, who vindicates me.</p>
            <p><sup>3</sup> He sends from heaven and saves me, rebuking those who hotly pursue me—God sends forth his love and his faithfulness.</p>
            <p><sup>4</sup> I am in the midst of lions; I am forced to dwell among ravenous beasts—men whose teeth are spears and arrows, whose tongues are sharp swords.</p>
            <p><sup>5</sup> Be exalted, O God, above the heavens; let your glory be over all the earth.</p>
            <p><sup>6</sup> They spread a net for my feet—I was bowed down in distress. They dug a pit in my path—but they have fallen into it themselves.</p>
            <p><sup>7</sup> My heart, O God, is steadfast; my heart is steadfast; I will sing and make music.</p>
            <p><sup>8</sup> Awake, my soul! Awake, harp and lyre! I will awaken the dawn.</p>
            <p><sup>9</sup> I will praise you, Lord, among the nations; I will sing of you among the peoples.</p>
            <p><sup>10</sup> For great is your love, reaching to the heavens; your faithfulness reaches to the skies.</p>
            <p><sup>11</sup> Be exalted, O God, above the heavens; let your glory be over all the earth.</p>
