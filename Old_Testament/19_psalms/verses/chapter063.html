            <h4>A psalm of David. When he was in the Desert of Judah.</h4>
            <p><sup>1</sup> You, God, are my God, earnestly I seek you; I thirst for you, my whole being longs for you, in a dry and parched land where there is no water.</p>
            <p><sup>2</sup> I have seen you in the sanctuary and beheld your power and your glory.</p>
            <p><sup>3</sup> Because your love is better than life, my lips will glorify you.</p>
            <p><sup>4</sup> I will praise you as long as I live, and in your name I will lift up my hands.</p>
            <p><sup>5</sup> I will be fully satisfied as with the richest of foods; with singing lips my mouth will praise you.</p>
            <p><sup>6</sup> On my bed I remember you; I think of you through the watches of the night.</p>
            <p><sup>7</sup> Because you are my help, I sing in the shadow of your wings.</p>
            <p><sup>8</sup> I cling to you; your right hand upholds me.</p>
            <p><sup>9</sup> Those who want to kill me will be destroyed; they will go down to the depths of the earth.</p>
            <p><sup>10</sup> They will be given over to the sword and become food for jackals.</p>
            <p><sup>11</sup> But the king will rejoice in God; all who swear by God will glory in him, while the mouths of liars will be silenced.</p>
