            <h4>For the director of music. To the tune of “Lilies.” Of David.</h4>
            <p><sup>1</sup> Save me, O God, for the waters have come up to my neck.</p>
            <p><sup>2</sup> I sink in the miry depths, where there is no foothold. I have come into the deep waters; the floods engulf me.</p>
            <p><sup>3</sup> I am worn out calling for help; my throat is parched. My eyes fail, looking for my God.</p>
            <p><sup>4</sup> Those who hate me without reason outnumber the hairs of my head; many are my enemies without cause, those who seek to destroy me. I am forced to restore what I did not steal.</p>
            <p><sup>5</sup> You, God, know my folly; my guilt is not hidden from you.</p>
            <p><sup>6</sup> Lord, the Lord Almighty, may those who hope in you not be disgraced because of me; God of Israel, may those who seek you not be put to shame because of me.</p>
            <p><sup>7</sup> For I endure scorn for your sake, and shame covers my face.</p>
            <p><sup>8</sup> I am a foreigner to my own family, a stranger to my own mother’s children;</p>
            <p><sup>9</sup> for zeal for your house consumes me, and the insults of those who insult you fall on me.</p>
            <p><sup>10</sup> When I weep and fast, I must endure scorn;</p>
            <p><sup>11</sup> when I put on sackcloth, people make sport of me.</p>
            <p><sup>12</sup> Those who sit at the gate mock me, and I am the song of the drunkards.</p>
            <p><sup>13</sup> But I pray to you, Lord, in the time of your favor; in your great love, O God, answer me with your sure salvation.</p>
            <p><sup>14</sup> Rescue me from the mire, do not let me sink; deliver me from those who hate me, from the deep waters.</p>
            <p><sup>15</sup> Do not let the floodwaters engulf me or the depths swallow me up or the pit close its mouth over me.</p>
            <p><sup>16</sup> Answer me, Lord, out of the goodness of your love; in your great mercy turn to me.</p>
            <p><sup>17</sup> Do not hide your face from your servant; answer me quickly, for I am in trouble.</p>
            <p><sup>18</sup> Come near and rescue me; deliver me because of my foes.</p>
            <p><sup>19</sup> You know how I am scorned, disgraced and shamed; all my enemies are before you.</p>
            <p><sup>20</sup> Scorn has broken my heart and has left me helpless; I looked for sympathy, but there was none, for comforters, but I found none.</p>
            <p><sup>21</sup> They put gall in my food and gave me vinegar for my thirst.</p>
            <p><sup>22</sup> May the table set before them become a snare; may it become retribution and a trap.</p>
            <p><sup>23</sup> May their eyes be darkened so they cannot see, and their backs be bent forever.</p>
            <p><sup>24</sup> Pour out your wrath on them; let your fierce anger overtake them.</p>
            <p><sup>25</sup> May their place be deserted; let there be no one to dwell in their tents.</p>
            <p><sup>26</sup> For they persecute those you wound and talk about the pain of those you hurt.</p>
            <p><sup>27</sup> Charge them with crime upon crime; do not let them share in your salvation.</p>
            <p><sup>28</sup> May they be blotted out of the book of life and not be listed with the righteous.</p>
            <p><sup>29</sup> But as for me, afflicted and in pain—may your salvation, God, protect me.</p>
            <p><sup>30</sup> I will praise God’s name in song and glorify him with thanksgiving.</p>
            <p><sup>31</sup> This will please the Lord more than an ox, more than a bull with its horns and hooves.</p>
            <p><sup>32</sup> The poor will see and be glad— you who seek God, may your hearts live!</p>
            <p><sup>33</sup> The Lord hears the needy and does not despise his captive people.</p>
            <p><sup>34</sup> Let heaven and earth praise him, the seas and all that move in them,</p>
            <p><sup>35</sup> for God will save Zion and rebuild the cities of Judah. Then people will settle there and possess it;</p>
            <p><sup>36</sup> the children of his servants will inherit it, and those who love his name will dwell there.</p>
