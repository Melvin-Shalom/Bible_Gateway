            <h4>For the director of music. Of David. A psalm.</h4>
            <p><sup>1</sup> My God, whom I praise, do not remain silent,</p>
            <p><sup>2</sup> for people who are wicked and deceitful have opened their mouths against me; they have spoken against me with lying tongues.</p>
            <p><sup>3</sup> With words of hatred they surround me; they attack me without cause.</p>
            <p><sup>4</sup> In return for my friendship they accuse me, but I am a man of prayer.</p>
            <p><sup>5</sup> They repay me evil for good, and hatred for my friendship.</p>
            <p><sup>6</sup> Appoint someone evil to oppose my enemy; let an accuser stand at his right hand.</p>
            <p><sup>7</sup> When he is tried, let him be found guilty, and may his prayers condemn him.</p>
            <p><sup>8</sup> May his days be few; may another take his place of leadership.</p>
            <p><sup>9</sup> May his children be fatherless and his wife a widow.</p>
            <p><sup>10</sup> May his children be wandering beggars; may they be driven from their ruined homes.</p>
            <p><sup>11</sup> May a creditor seize all he has; may strangers plunder the fruits of his labor.</p>
            <p><sup>12</sup> May no one extend kindness to him or take pity on his fatherless children.</p>
            <p><sup>13</sup> May his descendants be cut off, their names blotted out from the next generation.</p>
            <p><sup>14</sup> May the iniquity of his fathers be remembered before the Lord; may the sin of his mother never be blotted out.</p>
            <p><sup>15</sup> May their sins always remain before the Lord, that he may blot out their name from the earth.</p>
            <p><sup>16</sup> For he never thought of doing a kindness, but hounded to death the poor and the needy and the brokenhearted.</p>
            <p><sup>17</sup> He loved to pronounce a curse—may it come back on him. He found no pleasure in blessing—may it be far from him.</p>
            <p><sup>18</sup> He wore cursing as his garment; it entered into his body like water, into his bones like oil.</p>
            <p><sup>19</sup> May it be like a cloak wrapped about him, like a belt tied forever around him.</p>
            <p><sup>20</sup> May this be the Lord’s payment to my accusers, to those who speak evil of me.</p>
            <p><sup>21</sup> But you, Sovereign Lord, help me for your name’s sake; out of the goodness of your love, deliver me.</p>
            <p><sup>22</sup> For I am poor and needy, and my heart is wounded within me.</p>
            <p><sup>23</sup> I fade away like an evening shadow; I am shaken off like a locust.</p>
            <p><sup>24</sup> My knees give way from fasting; my body is thin and gaunt.</p>
            <p><sup>25</sup> I am an object of scorn to my accusers; when they see me, they shake their heads.</p>
            <p><sup>26</sup> Help me, Lord my God; save me according to your unfailing love.</p>
            <p><sup>27</sup> Let them know that it is your hand, that you, Lord, have done it.</p>
            <p><sup>28</sup> While they curse, may you bless; may those who attack me be put to shame, but may your servant rejoice.</p>
            <p><sup>29</sup> May my accusers be clothed with disgrace and wrapped in shame as in a cloak.</p>
            <p><sup>30</sup> With my mouth I will greatly extol the Lord; in the great throng of worshipers I will praise him.</p>
            <p><sup>31</sup> For he stands at the right hand of the needy, to save their lives from those who would condemn them.</p>
