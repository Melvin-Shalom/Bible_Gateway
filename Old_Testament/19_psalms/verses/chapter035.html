            <h4>Of David.</h4>
            <p><sup>1</sup> Contend, Lord, with those who contend with me; fight against those who fight against me.</p>
            <p><sup>2</sup> Take up shield and armor; arise and come to my aid.</p>
            <p><sup>3</sup> Brandish spear and javelin against those who pursue me. Say to me, "I am your salvation."</p>
            <p><sup>4</sup> May those who seek my life be disgraced and put to shame; may those who plot my ruin be turned back in dismay.</p>
            <p><sup>5</sup> May they be like chaff before the wind, with the angel of the Lord driving them away;</p>
            <p><sup>6</sup> may their path be dark and slippery, with the angel of the Lord pursuing them.</p>
            <p><sup>7</sup> Since they hid their net for me without cause and without cause dug a pit for me,</p>
            <p><sup>8</sup> may ruin overtake them by surpriseâ€”may the net they hid entangle them, may they fall into the pit, to their ruin.</p>
            <p><sup>9</sup> Then my soul will rejoice in the Lord and delight in his salvation.</p>
            <p><sup>10</sup> My whole being will exclaim, "Who is like you, Lord? You rescue the poor from those too strong for them, the poor and needy from those who rob them."</p>
            <p><sup>11</sup> Ruthless witnesses come forward; they question me on things I know nothing about.</p>
            <p><sup>12</sup> They repay me evil for good and leave me like one bereaved.</p>
            <p><sup>13</sup> Yet when they were ill, I put on sackcloth and humbled myself with fasting. When my prayers returned to me unanswered,</p>
            <p><sup>14</sup> I went about mourning as though for my friend or brother. I bowed my head in grief as though weeping for my mother.</p>
            <p><sup>15</sup> But when I stumbled, they gathered in glee; assailants gathered against me without my knowledge. They slandered me without ceasing.</p>
            <p><sup>16</sup> Like the ungodly they maliciously mocked; they gnashed their teeth at me.</p>
            <p><sup>17</sup> How long, Lord, will you look on? Rescue me from their ravages, my precious life from these lions.</p>
            <p><sup>18</sup> I will give you thanks in the great assembly; among the throngs I will praise you.</p>
            <p><sup>19</sup> Do not let those gloat over me who are my enemies without cause; do not let those who hate me without reason maliciously wink the eye.</p>
            <p><sup>20</sup> They do not speak peaceably, but devise false accusations against those who live quietly in the land.</p>
            <p><sup>21</sup> They sneer at me and say, "Aha! Aha! With our own eyes we have seen it."</p>
            <p><sup>22</sup> Lord, you have seen this; do not be silent. Do not be far from me, Lord.</p>
            <p><sup>23</sup> Awake, and rise to my defense! Contend for me, my God and Lord.</p>
            <p><sup>24</sup> Vindicate me in your righteousness, Lord my God; do not let them gloat over me.</p>
            <p><sup>25</sup> Do not let them think, "Aha, just what we wanted!" or say, "We have swallowed him up."</p>
            <p><sup>26</sup> May all who gloat over my distress be put to shame and confusion; may all who exalt themselves over me be clothed with shame and disgrace.</p>
            <p><sup>27</sup> May those who delight in my vindication shout for joy and gladness; may they always say, "The Lord be exalted, who delights in the well-being of his servant."</p>
            <p><sup>28</sup> My tongue will proclaim your righteousness, your praises all day long.</p>
