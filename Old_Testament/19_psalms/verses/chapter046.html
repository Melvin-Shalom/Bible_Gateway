            <h4>For the director of music. Of the Sons of Korah. According to alamoth. A song.</h4>
            <p><sup>1</sup> God is our refuge and strength, an ever-present help in trouble.</p>
            <p><sup>2</sup> Therefore we will not fear, though the earth give way and the mountains fall into the heart of the sea,</p>
            <p><sup>3</sup> though its waters roar and foam and the mountains quake with their surging.</p>
            <p><sup>4</sup> There is a river whose streams make glad the city of God, the holy place where the Most High dwells.</p>
            <p><sup>5</sup> God is within her, she will not fall; God will help her at break of day.</p>
            <p><sup>6</sup> Nations are in uproar, kingdoms fall; he lifts his voice, the earth melts.</p>
            <p><sup>7</sup> The Lord Almighty is with us; the God of Jacob is our fortress.</p>
            <p><sup>8</sup> Come and see what the Lord has done, the desolations he has brought on the earth.</p>
            <p><sup>9</sup> He makes wars cease to the ends of the earth. He breaks the bow and shatters the spear; he burns the shields with fire.</p>
            <p><sup>10</sup> He says, “Be still, and know that I am God; I will be exalted among the nations, I will be exalted in the earth.”</p>
            <p><sup>11</sup> The Lord Almighty is with us; the God of Jacob is our fortress.</p>
