        <h1>Psalm 135</h1>
    </header>
    <main>
        <div>
            <p><sup>1</sup> Praise the Lord. Praise the name of the Lord; praise him, you servants of the Lord,</p>
            <p><sup>2</sup> you who minister in the house of the Lord, in the courts of the house of our God.</p>
            <p><sup>3</sup> Praise the Lord, for the Lord is good; sing praise to his name, for that is pleasant.</p>
            <p><sup>4</sup> For the Lord has chosen Jacob to be his own, Israel to be his treasured possession.</p>
            <p><sup>5</sup> I know that the Lord is great, that our Lord is greater than all gods.</p>
            <p><sup>6</sup> The Lord does whatever pleases him, in the heavens and on the earth, in the seas and all their depths.</p>
            <p><sup>7</sup> He makes clouds rise from the ends of the earth; he sends lightning with the rain and brings out the wind from his storehouses.</p>
            <p><sup>8</sup> He struck down the firstborn of Egypt, the firstborn of people and animals.</p>
            <p><sup>9</sup> He sent his signs and wonders into your midst, Egypt, against Pharaoh and all his servants.</p>
            <p><sup>10</sup> He struck down many nations and killed mighty kings—</p>
            <p><sup>11</sup> Sihon king of the Amorites, Og king of Bashan, and all the kings of Canaan—</p>
            <p><sup>12</sup> and he gave their land as an inheritance, an inheritance to his people Israel.</p>
            <p><sup>13</sup> Your name, Lord, endures forever, your renown, Lord, through all generations.</p>
            <p><sup>14</sup> For the Lord will vindicate his people and have compassion on his servants.</p>
            <p><sup>15</sup> The idols of the nations are silver and gold, made by human hands.</p>
            <p><sup>16</sup> They have mouths, but cannot speak, eyes, but cannot see.</p>
            <p><sup>17</sup> They have ears, but cannot hear, nor is there breath in their mouths.</p>
            <p><sup>18</sup> Those who make them will be like them, and so will all who trust in them.</p>
            <p><sup>19</sup> All you Israelites, praise the Lord; house of Aaron, praise the Lord;</p>
            <p><sup>20</sup> house of Levi, praise the Lord; you who fear him, praise the Lord.</p>
            <p><sup>21</sup> Praise be to the Lord from Zion, to him who dwells in Jerusalem. Praise the Lord.</p>
