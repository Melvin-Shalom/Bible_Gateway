            <h4>For the director of music. To the tune of “Do Not Destroy.” Of David. A miktam.</h4>
            <p><sup>1</sup> Do you rulers indeed speak justly? Do you judge people with equity?</p>
            <p><sup>2</sup> No, in your heart you devise injustice, and your hands mete out violence on the earth.</p>
            <p><sup>3</sup> Even from birth the wicked go astray; from the womb they are wayward, spreading lies.</p>
            <p><sup>4</sup> Their venom is like the venom of a snake, like that of a cobra that has stopped its ears,</p>
            <p><sup>5</sup> that will not heed the tune of the charmer, however skillful the enchanter may be.</p>
            <p><sup>6</sup> Break the teeth in their mouths, O God; Lord, tear out the fangs of those lions!</p>
            <p><sup>7</sup> Let them vanish like water that flows away; when they draw the bow, let their arrows fall short.</p>
            <p><sup>8</sup> May they be like a slug that melts away as it moves along, like a stillborn child that never sees the sun.</p>
            <p><sup>9</sup> Before your pots can feel the heat of the thorns—whether they be green or dry—the wicked will be swept away.</p>
            <p><sup>10</sup> The righteous will be glad when they are avenged, when they dip their feet in the blood of the wicked.</p>
            <p><sup>11</sup> Then people will say, “Surely the righteous still are rewarded; surely there is a God who judges the earth.”</p>
