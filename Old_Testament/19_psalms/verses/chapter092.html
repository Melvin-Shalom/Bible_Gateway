            <h4>A psalm. A song. For the Sabbath day.</h4>
            <p><sup>1</sup> It is good to praise the Lord and make music to your name, O Most High,</p>
            <p><sup>2</sup> proclaiming your love in the morning and your faithfulness at night,</p>
            <p><sup>3</sup> to the music of the ten-stringed lyre and the melody of the harp.</p>
            <p><sup>4</sup> For you make me glad by your deeds, Lord; I sing for joy at what your hands have done.</p>
            <p><sup>5</sup> How great are your works, Lord, how profound your thoughts!</p>
            <p><sup>6</sup> Senseless people do not know, fools do not understand,</p>
            <p><sup>7</sup> that though the wicked spring up like grass and all evildoers flourish, they will be destroyed forever.</p>
            <p><sup>8</sup> But you, Lord, are forever exalted.</p>
            <p><sup>9</sup> For surely your enemies, Lord, surely your enemies will perish; all evildoers will be scattered.</p>
            <p><sup>10</sup> You have exalted my horn like that of a wild ox; fine oils have been poured on me.</p>
            <p><sup>11</sup> My eyes have seen the defeat of my adversaries; my ears have heard the rout of my wicked foes.</p>
            <p><sup>12</sup> The righteous will flourish like a palm tree, they will grow like a cedar of Lebanon;</p>
            <p><sup>13</sup> planted in the house of the Lord, they will flourish in the courts of our God.</p>
            <p><sup>14</sup> They will still bear fruit in old age, they will stay fresh and green,</p>
            <p><sup>15</sup> proclaiming, “The Lord is upright; he is my Rock, and there is no wickedness in him.”</p>
