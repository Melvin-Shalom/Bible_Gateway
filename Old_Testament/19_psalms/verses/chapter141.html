            <h4>A psalm of David.</h4>
            <p><sup>1</sup> I call to you, Lord, come quickly to me; hear me when I call to you.</p>
            <p><sup>2</sup> May my prayer be set before you like incense; may the lifting up of my hands be like the evening sacrifice.</p>
            <p><sup>3</sup> Set a guard over my mouth, Lord; keep watch over the door of my lips.</p>
            <p><sup>4</sup> Do not let my heart be drawn to what is evil so that I take part in wicked deeds along with those who are evildoers; do not let me eat their delicacies.</p>
            <p><sup>5</sup> Let a righteous man strike me—it is a kindness; let him rebuke me—it is oil on my head. My head will not refuse it. For my prayer will still be against the deeds of evildoers.</p>
            <p><sup>6</sup> Their rulers will be thrown down from the cliffs, and the wicked will learn that my words were well spoken.</p>
            <p><sup>7</sup> They will say, “As one plows and breaks up the earth, so our bones have been scattered at the mouth of the grave.”</p>
            <p><sup>8</sup> But my eyes are fixed on you, Sovereign Lord; in you I take refuge—do not give me over to death.</p>
            <p><sup>9</sup> Keep me safe from the traps set by evildoers, from the snares they have laid for me.</p>
            <p><sup>10</sup> Let the wicked fall into their own nets, while I pass by in safety.</p>
