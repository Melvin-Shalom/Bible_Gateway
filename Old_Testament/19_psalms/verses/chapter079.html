            <h4>A psalm of Asaph.</h4>
            <p><sup>1</sup> O God, the nations have invaded your inheritance; they have defiled your holy temple, they have reduced Jerusalem to rubble.</p>
            <p><sup>2</sup> They have given the dead bodies of your servants as food to the birds in the sky, the flesh of your faithful ones to the beasts of the earth.</p>
            <p><sup>3</sup> They have poured out blood like water all around Jerusalem, and there is no one to bury the dead.</p>
            <p><sup>4</sup> We are objects of contempt to our neighbors, of scorn and derision to those around us.</p>
            <p><sup>5</sup> How long, Lord? Will you be angry forever? How long will your jealousy burn like fire?</p>
            <p><sup>6</sup> Pour out your wrath on the nations that do not acknowledge you, on the kingdoms that do not call on your name;</p>
            <p><sup>7</sup> for they have devoured Jacob and devastated his homeland.</p>
            <p><sup>8</sup> Do not hold against us the sins of past generations; may your mercy come quickly to meet us, for we are in desperate need.</p>
            <p><sup>9</sup> Help us, God our Savior, for the glory of your name; deliver us and forgive our sins for your name’s sake.</p>
            <p><sup>10</sup> Why should the nations say, “Where is their God?” Before our eyes, make known among the nations that you avenge the outpoured blood of your servants.</p>
            <p><sup>11</sup> May the groans of the prisoners come before you; with your strong arm preserve those condemned to die.</p>
            <p><sup>12</sup> Pay back into the laps of our neighbors seven times the contempt they have hurled at you, Lord.</p>
            <p><sup>13</sup> Then we your people, the sheep of your pasture, will praise you forever; from generation to generation we will proclaim your praise.</p>
