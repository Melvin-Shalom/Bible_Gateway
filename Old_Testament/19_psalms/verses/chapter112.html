            <p><sup>1</sup> Praise the Lord. Blessed are those who fear the Lord, who find great delight in his commands.</p>
            <p><sup>2</sup> Their children will be mighty in the land; the generation of the upright will be blessed.</p>
            <p><sup>3</sup> Wealth and riches are in their houses, and their righteousness endures forever.</p>
            <p><sup>4</sup> Even in darkness light dawns for the upright, for those who are gracious and compassionate and righteous.</p>
            <p><sup>5</sup> Good will come to those who are generous and lend freely, who conduct their affairs with justice.</p>
            <p><sup>6</sup> Surely the righteous will never be shaken; they will be remembered forever.</p>
            <p><sup>7</sup> They will have no fear of bad news; their hearts are steadfast, trusting in the Lord.</p>
            <p><sup>8</sup> Their hearts are secure, they will have no fear; in the end they will look in triumph on their foes.</p>
            <p><sup>9</sup> They have freely scattered their gifts to the poor, their righteousness endures forever; their horn will be lifted high in honor.</p>
            <p><sup>10</sup> The wicked will see and be vexed, they will gnash their teeth and waste away; the longings of the wicked will come to nothing.</p>
