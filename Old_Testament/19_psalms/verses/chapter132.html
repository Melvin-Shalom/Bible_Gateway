            <p><sup>1</sup> Lord, remember David and all his self-denial.</p>
            <p><sup>2</sup> He swore an oath to the Lord, he made a vow to the Mighty One of Jacob:</p>
            <p><sup>3</sup> “I will not enter my house or go to my bed,</p>
            <p><sup>4</sup> I will allow no sleep to my eyes or slumber to my eyelids,</p>
            <p><sup>5</sup> till I find a place for the Lord, a dwelling for the Mighty One of Jacob.”</p>
            <p><sup>6</sup> We heard it in Ephrathah, we came upon it in the fields of Jaar:</p>
            <p><sup>7</sup> “Let us go to his dwelling place, let us worship at his footstool, saying,</p>
            <p><sup>8</sup> ‘Arise, Lord, and come to your resting place, you and the ark of your might.</p>
            <p><sup>9</sup> May your priests be clothed with your righteousness; may your faithful people sing for joy.’”</p>
            <p><sup>10</sup> For the sake of your servant David, do not reject your anointed one.</p>
            <p><sup>11</sup> The Lord swore an oath to David, a sure oath he will not revoke: “One of your own descendants I will place on your throne.</p>
            <p><sup>12</sup> If your sons keep my covenant and the statutes I teach them, then their sons will sit on your throne for ever and ever.”</p>
            <p><sup>13</sup> For the Lord has chosen Zion, he has desired it for his dwelling, saying,</p>
            <p><sup>14</sup> “This is my resting place for ever and ever; here I will sit enthroned, for I have desired it.</p>
            <p><sup>15</sup> I will bless her with abundant provisions; her poor I will satisfy with food.</p>
            <p><sup>16</sup> I will clothe her priests with salvation, and her faithful people will ever sing for joy.</p>
            <p><sup>17</sup> “Here I will make a horn grow for David and set up a lamp for my anointed one.</p>
            <p><sup>18</sup> I will clothe his enemies with shame, but his head will be adorned with a radiant crown.”</p>
