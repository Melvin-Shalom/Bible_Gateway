            <h4>Of David.</h4>
            <p><sup>1</sup> Do not fret because of those who are evil or be envious of those who do wrong;</p>
            <p><sup>2</sup> for like the grass they will soon wither, like green plants they will soon die away.</p>
            <p><sup>3</sup> Trust in the Lord and do good; dwell in the land and enjoy safe pasture.</p>
            <p><sup>4</sup> Take delight in the Lord, and he will give you the desires of your heart.</p>
            <p><sup>5</sup> Commit your way to the Lord; trust in him and he will do this:</p>
            <p><sup>6</sup> He will make your righteous reward shine like the dawn, your vindication like the noonday sun.</p>
            <p><sup>7</sup> Be still before the Lord and wait patiently for him; do not fret when people succeed in their ways, when they carry out their wicked schemes.</p>
            <p><sup>8</sup> Refrain from anger and turn from wrath; do not fret—it leads only to evil.</p>
            <p><sup>9</sup> For those who are evil will be destroyed, but those who hope in the Lord will inherit the land.</p>
            <p><sup>10</sup> A little while, and the wicked will be no more; though you look for them, they will not be found.</p>
            <p><sup>11</sup> But the meek will inherit the land and enjoy peace and prosperity.</p>
            <p><sup>12</sup> The wicked plot against the righteous and gnash their teeth at them;</p>
            <p><sup>13</sup> but the Lord laughs at the wicked, for he knows their day is coming.</p>
            <p><sup>14</sup> The wicked draw the sword and bend the bow to bring down the poor and needy, to slay those whose ways are upright.</p>
            <p><sup>15</sup> But their swords will pierce their own hearts, and their bows will be broken.</p>
            <p><sup>16</sup> Better the little that the righteous have than the wealth of many wicked;</p>
            <p><sup>17</sup> for the power of the wicked will be broken, but the Lord upholds the righteous.</p>
            <p><sup>18</sup> The blameless spend their days under the Lord’s care, and their inheritance will endure forever.</p>
            <p><sup>19</sup> In times of disaster they will not wither; in days of famine they will enjoy plenty.</p>
            <p><sup>20</sup> But the wicked will perish: Though the Lord’s enemies are like the flowers of the field, they will be consumed, they will go up in smoke.</p>
            <p><sup>21</sup> The wicked borrow and do not repay, but the righteous give generously;</p>
            <p><sup>22</sup> those the Lord blesses will inherit the land, but those he curses will be destroyed.</p>
            <p><sup>23</sup> The Lord makes firm the steps of the one who delights in him;</p>
            <p><sup>24</sup> though he may stumble, he will not fall, for the Lord upholds him with his hand.</p>
            <p><sup>25</sup> I was young and now I am old, yet I have never seen the righteous forsaken or their children begging bread.</p>
            <p><sup>26</sup> They are always generous and lend freely; their children will be a blessing.</p>
            <p><sup>27</sup> Turn from evil and do good; then you will dwell in the land forever.</p>
            <p><sup>28</sup> For the Lord loves the just and will not forsake his faithful ones. Wrongdoers will be completely destroyed; the offspring of the wicked will perish.</p>
            <p><sup>29</sup> The righteous will inherit the land and dwell in it forever.</p>
            <p><sup>30</sup> The mouths of the righteous utter wisdom, and their tongues speak what is just.</p>
            <p><sup>31</sup> The law of their God is in their hearts; their feet do not slip.</p>
            <p><sup>32</sup> The wicked lie in wait for the righteous, intent on putting them to death;</p>
            <p><sup>33</sup> but the Lord will not leave them in the power of the wicked or let them be condemned when brought to trial.</p>
            <p><sup>34</sup> Hope in the Lord and keep his way. He will exalt you to inherit the land; when the wicked are destroyed, you will see it.</p>
            <p><sup>35</sup> I have seen a wicked and ruthless man flourishing like a luxuriant native tree,</p>
            <p><sup>36</sup> but he soon passed away and was no more; though I looked for him, he could not be found.</p>
            <p><sup>37</sup> Consider the blameless, observe the upright; a future awaits those who seek peace.</p>
            <p><sup>38</sup> But all sinners will be destroyed; there will be no future for the wicked.</p>
            <p><sup>39</sup> The salvation of the righteous comes from the Lord; he is their stronghold in time of trouble.</p>
            <p><sup>40</sup> The Lord helps them and delivers them; he delivers them from the wicked and saves them, because they take refuge in him.</p>
