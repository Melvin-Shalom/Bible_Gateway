            <h4>A psalm of David.</h4>
            <p><sup>1</sup> Ascribe to the Lord, you heavenly beings, ascribe to the Lord glory and strength.</p>
            <p><sup>2</sup> Ascribe to the Lord the glory due his name; worship the Lord in the splendor of his holiness.</p>
            <p><sup>3</sup> The voice of the Lord is over the waters; the God of glory thunders, the Lord thunders over the mighty waters.</p>
            <p><sup>4</sup> The voice of the Lord is powerful; the voice of the Lord is majestic.</p>
            <p><sup>5</sup> The voice of the Lord breaks the cedars; the Lord breaks in pieces the cedars of Lebanon.</p>
            <p><sup>6</sup> He makes Lebanon leap like a calf, Sirion like a young wild ox.</p>
            <p><sup>7</sup> The voice of the Lord strikes with flashes of lightning.</p>
            <p><sup>8</sup> The voice of the Lord shakes the desert; the Lord shakes the Desert of Kadesh.</p>
            <p><sup>9</sup> The voice of the Lord twists the oaks and strips the forests bare. And in his temple all cry, “Glory!”</p>
            <p><sup>10</sup> The Lord sits enthroned over the flood; the Lord is enthroned as King forever.</p>
            <p><sup>11</sup> The Lord gives strength to his people; the Lord blesses his people with peace.</p>
