            <p><sup>1</sup> When Israel came out of Egypt, Jacob from a people of foreign tongue,</p>
            <p><sup>2</sup> Judah became Godâ€™s sanctuary, Israel his dominion.</p>
            <p><sup>3</sup> The sea looked and fled, the Jordan turned back;</p>
            <p><sup>4</sup> the mountains leaped like rams, the hills like lambs.</p>
            <p><sup>5</sup> Why was it, sea, that you fled? Why, Jordan, did you turn back?</p>
            <p><sup>6</sup> Why, mountains, did you leap like rams, you hills, like lambs?</p>
            <p><sup>7</sup> Tremble, earth, at the presence of the Lord, at the presence of the God of Jacob,</p>
            <p><sup>8</sup> who turned the rock into a pool, the hard rock into springs of water.</p>
