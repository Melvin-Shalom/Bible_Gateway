            <h4>Of David.</h4>
            <p><sup>1</sup> The Lord is my light and my salvation— whom shall I fear? The Lord is the stronghold of my life— of whom shall I be afraid?</p>
            <p><sup>2</sup> When the wicked advance against me to devour me, it is my enemies and my foes who will stumble and fall.</p>
            <p><sup>3</sup> Though an army besiege me, my heart will not fear; though war break out against me, even then I will be confident.</p>
            <p><sup>4</sup> One thing I ask from the Lord, this only do I seek: that I may dwell in the house of the Lord all the days of my life, to gaze on the beauty of the Lord and to seek him in his temple.</p>
            <p><sup>5</sup> For in the day of trouble he will keep me safe in his dwelling; he will hide me in the shelter of his sacred tent and set me high upon a rock.</p>
            <p><sup>6</sup> Then my head will be exalted above the enemies who surround me; at his sacred tent I will sacrifice with shouts of joy; I will sing and make music to the Lord.</p>
            <p><sup>7</sup> Hear my voice when I call, Lord; be merciful to me and answer me.</p>
            <p><sup>8</sup> My heart says of you, “Seek his face!” Your face, Lord, I will seek.</p>
            <p><sup>9</sup> Do not hide your face from me, do not turn your servant away in anger; you have been my helper. Do not reject me or forsake me, God my Savior.</p>
            <p><sup>10</sup> Though my father and mother forsake me, the Lord will receive me.</p>
            <p><sup>11</sup> Teach me your way, Lord; lead me in a straight path because of my oppressors.</p>
            <p><sup>12</sup> Do not turn me over to the desire of my foes, for false witnesses rise up against me, spouting malicious accusations.</p>
            <p><sup>13</sup> I remain confident of this: I will see the goodness of the Lord in the land of the living.</p>
            <p><sup>14</sup> Wait for the Lord; be strong and take heart and wait for the Lord.</p>
