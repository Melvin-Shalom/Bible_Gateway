            <h4>A psalm of David. When he fled from his son Absalom.</h4>
            <p><sup>1</sup> Lord, how many are my foes! How many rise up against me!</p>
            <p><sup>2</sup> Many are saying of me, “God will not deliver him.”</p>
            <p><sup>3</sup> But you, Lord, are a shield around me, my glory, the One who lifts my head high.</p>
            <p><sup>4</sup> I call out to the Lord, and he answers me from his holy mountain.</p>
            <p><sup>5</sup> I lie down and sleep; I wake again, because the Lord sustains me.</p>
            <p><sup>6</sup> I will not fear though tens of thousands assail me on every side.</p>
            <p><sup>7</sup> Arise, Lord! Deliver me, my God! Strike all my enemies on the jaw; break the teeth of the wicked.</p>
            <p><sup>8</sup> From the Lord comes deliverance. May your blessing be on your people.</p>
