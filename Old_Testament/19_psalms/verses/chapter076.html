            <h4>For the director of music. With stringed instruments. A psalm of Asaph. A song.</h4>
            <p><sup>1</sup> God is renowned in Judah; in Israel his name is great.</p>
            <p><sup>2</sup> His tent is in Salem, his dwelling place in Zion.</p>
            <p><sup>3</sup> There he broke the flashing arrows, the shields and the swords, the weapons of war.</p>
            <p><sup>4</sup> You are radiant with light, more majestic than mountains rich with game.</p>
            <p><sup>5</sup> The valiant lie plundered, they sleep their last sleep; not one of the warriors can lift his hands.</p>
            <p><sup>6</sup> At your rebuke, God of Jacob, both horse and chariot lie stunned.</p>
            <p><sup>7</sup> It is you alone who are to be feared. Who can stand before you when you are angry?</p>
            <p><sup>8</sup> From heaven you pronounced judgment, and the land feared and was quietâ€”</p>
            <p><sup>9</sup> when you, God, rose up to judge, to save all the afflicted of the land.</p>
            <p><sup>10</sup> Surely your wrath against mankind brings you praise, and the survivors of your wrath are restrained.</p>
            <p><sup>11</sup> Make vows to the Lord your God and fulfill them; let all the neighboring lands bring gifts to the One to be feared.</p>
            <p><sup>12</sup> He breaks the spirit of rulers; he is feared by the kings of the earth.</p>
