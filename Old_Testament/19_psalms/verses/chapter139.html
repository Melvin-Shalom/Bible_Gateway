            <h4>For the director of music. Of David. A psalm.</h4>
            <p><sup>1</sup> You have searched me, Lord, and you know me.</p>
            <p><sup>2</sup> You know when I sit and when I rise; you perceive my thoughts from afar.</p>
            <p><sup>3</sup> You discern my going out and my lying down; you are familiar with all my ways.</p>
            <p><sup>4</sup> Before a word is on my tongue you, Lord, know it completely.</p>
            <p><sup>5</sup> You hem me in behind and before, and you lay your hand upon me.</p>
            <p><sup>6</sup> Such knowledge is too wonderful for me, too lofty for me to attain.</p>
            <p><sup>7</sup> Where can I go from your Spirit? Where can I flee from your presence?</p>
            <p><sup>8</sup> If I go up to the heavens, you are there; if I make my bed in the depths, you are there.</p>
            <p><sup>9</sup> If I rise on the wings of the dawn, if I settle on the far side of the sea,</p>
            <p><sup>10</sup> even there your hand will guide me, your right hand will hold me fast.</p>
            <p><sup>11</sup> If I say, “Surely the darkness will hide me and the light become night around me,”</p>
            <p><sup>12</sup> even the darkness will not be dark to you; the night will shine like the day, for darkness is as light to you.</p>
            <p><sup>13</sup> For you created my inmost being; you knit me together in my mother’s womb.</p>
            <p><sup>14</sup> I praise you because I am fearfully and wonderfully made; your works are wonderful, I know that full well.</p>
            <p><sup>15</sup> My frame was not hidden from you when I was made in the secret place, when I was woven together in the depths of the earth.</p>
            <p><sup>16</sup> Your eyes saw my unformed body; all the days ordained for me were written in your book before one of them came to be.</p>
            <p><sup>17</sup> How precious to me are your thoughts, God! How vast is the sum of them!</p>
            <p><sup>18</sup> Were I to count them, they would outnumber the grains of sand—when I awake, I am still with you.</p>
            <p><sup>19</sup> If only you, God, would slay the wicked! Away from me, you who are bloodthirsty!</p>
            <p><sup>20</sup> They speak of you with evil intent; your adversaries misuse your name.</p>
            <p><sup>21</sup> Do I not hate those who hate you, Lord, and abhor those who are in rebellion against you?</p>
            <p><sup>22</sup> I have nothing but hatred for them; I count them my enemies.</p>
            <p><sup>23</sup> Search me, God, and know my heart; test me and know my anxious thoughts.</p>
            <p><sup>24</sup> See if there is any offensive way in me, and lead me in the way everlasting.</p>
