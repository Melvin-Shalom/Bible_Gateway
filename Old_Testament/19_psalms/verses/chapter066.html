            <h4>For the director of music. A song. A psalm.</h4>
            <p><sup>1</sup> Shout for joy to God, all the earth!</p>
            <p><sup>2</sup> Sing the glory of his name; make his praise glorious.</p>
            <p><sup>3</sup> Say to God, “How awesome are your deeds! So great is your power that your enemies cringe before you.</p>
            <p><sup>4</sup> All the earth bows down to you; they sing praise to you, they sing the praises of your name.”</p>
            <p><sup>5</sup> Come and see what God has done, his awesome deeds for mankind!</p>
            <p><sup>6</sup> He turned the sea into dry land, they passed through the waters on foot. Come, let us rejoice in him.</p>
            <p><sup>7</sup> He rules forever by his power, his eyes watch the nations—let not the rebellious rise up against him.</p>
            <p><sup>8</sup> Praise our God, O peoples, let the sound of his praise be heard;</p>
            <p><sup>9</sup> he has preserved our lives and kept our feet from slipping.</p>
            <p><sup>10</sup> For you, God, tested us; you refined us like silver.</p>
            <p><sup>11</sup> You brought us into prison and laid burdens on our backs.</p>
            <p><sup>12</sup> You let people ride over our heads; we went through fire and water, but you brought us to a place of abundance.</p>
            <p><sup>13</sup> I will come to your temple with burnt offerings and fulfill my vows to you—</p>
            <p><sup>14</sup> vows my lips promised and my mouth spoke when I was in trouble.</p>
            <p><sup>15</sup> I will sacrifice fat animals to you and an offering of rams; I will offer bulls and goats.</p>
            <p><sup>16</sup> Come and hear, all you who fear God; let me tell you what he has done for me.</p>
            <p><sup>17</sup> I cried out to him with my mouth; his praise was on my tongue.</p>
            <p><sup>18</sup> If I had cherished sin in my heart, the Lord would not have listened;</p>
            <p><sup>19</sup> but God has surely listened and has heard my prayer.</p>
            <p><sup>20</sup> Praise be to God, who has not rejected my prayer or withheld his love from me!</p>
