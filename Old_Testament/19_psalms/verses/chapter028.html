            <h4>Of David.</h4>
            <p><sup>1</sup> To you, Lord, I call; you are my Rock, do not turn a deaf ear to me. For if you remain silent, I will be like those who go down to the pit.</p>
            <p><sup>2</sup> Hear my cry for mercy as I call to you for help, as I lift up my hands toward your Most Holy Place.</p>
            <p><sup>3</sup> Do not drag me away with the wicked, with those who do evil, who speak cordially with their neighbors but harbor malice in their hearts.</p>
            <p><sup>4</sup> Repay them for their deeds and for their evil work; repay them for what their hands have done and bring back on them what they deserve.</p>
            <p><sup>5</sup> Because they have no regard for the deeds of the Lord and what his hands have done, he will tear them down and never build them up again.</p>
            <p><sup>6</sup> Praise be to the Lord, for he has heard my cry for mercy.</p>
            <p><sup>7</sup> The Lord is my strength and my shield; my heart trusts in him, and he helps me. My heart leaps for joy, and with my song I praise him.</p>
            <p><sup>8</sup> The Lord is the strength of his people, a fortress of salvation for his anointed one.</p>
            <p><sup>9</sup> Save your people and bless your inheritance; be their shepherd and carry them forever.</p>
