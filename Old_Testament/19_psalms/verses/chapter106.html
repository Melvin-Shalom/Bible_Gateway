            <p><sup>1</sup> Praise the Lord. Give thanks to the Lord, for he is good; his love endures forever.</p>
            <p><sup>2</sup> Who can proclaim the mighty acts of the Lord or fully declare his praise?</p>
            <p><sup>3</sup> Blessed are those who act justly, who always do what is right.</p>
            <p><sup>4</sup> Remember me, Lord, when you show favor to your people, come to my aid when you save them,</p>
            <p><sup>5</sup> that I may enjoy the prosperity of your chosen ones, that I may share in the joy of your nation and join your inheritance in giving praise.</p>
            <p><sup>6</sup> We have sinned, even as our ancestors did; we have done wrong and acted wickedly.</p>
            <p><sup>7</sup> When our ancestors were in Egypt, they gave no thought to your miracles; they did not remember your many kindnesses, and they rebelled by the sea, the Red Sea.</p>
            <p><sup>8</sup> Yet he saved them for his name's sake, to make his mighty power known.</p>
            <p><sup>9</sup> He rebuked the Red Sea, and it dried up; he led them through the depths as through a desert.</p>
            <p><sup>10</sup> He saved them from the hand of the foe; from the hand of the enemy he redeemed them.</p>
            <p><sup>11</sup> The waters covered their adversaries; not one of them survived.</p>
            <p><sup>12</sup> Then they believed his promises and sang his praise.</p>
            <p><sup>13</sup> But they soon forgot what he had done and did not wait for his plan to unfold.</p>
            <p><sup>14</sup> In the desert they gave in to their craving; in the wilderness they put God to the test.</p>
            <p><sup>15</sup> So he gave them what they asked for, but sent a wasting disease among them.</p>
            <p><sup>16</sup> In the camp they grew envious of Moses and of Aaron, who was consecrated to the Lord.</p>
            <p><sup>17</sup> The earth opened up and swallowed Dathan; it buried the company of Abiram.</p>
            <p><sup>18</sup> Fire blazed among their followers; a flame consumed the wicked.</p>
            <p><sup>19</sup> At Horeb they made a calf and worshiped an idol cast from metal.</p>
            <p><sup>20</sup> They exchanged their glorious God for an image of a bull, which eats grass.</p>
            <p><sup>21</sup> They forgot the God who saved them, who had done great things in Egypt,</p>
            <p><sup>22</sup> miracles in the land of Ham and awesome deeds by the Red Sea.</p>
            <p><sup>23</sup> So he said he would destroy them— had not Moses, his chosen one, stood in the breach before him to keep his wrath from destroying them.</p>
            <p><sup>24</sup> Then they despised the pleasant land; they did not believe his promise.</p>
            <p><sup>25</sup> They grumbled in their tents and did not obey the Lord.</p>
            <p><sup>26</sup> So he swore to them with uplifted hand that he would make them fall in the wilderness,</p>
            <p><sup>27</sup> make their descendants fall among the nations and scatter them throughout the lands.</p>
            <p><sup>28</sup> They yoked themselves to the Baal of Peor and ate sacrifices offered to lifeless gods;</p>
            <p><sup>29</sup> they aroused the Lord's anger by their wicked deeds, and a plague broke out among them.</p>
            <p><sup>30</sup> But Phinehas stood up and intervened, and the plague was checked.</p>
            <p><sup>31</sup> This was credited to him as righteousness for endless generations to come.</p>
            <p><sup>32</sup> By the waters of Meribah they angered the Lord, and trouble came to Moses because of them;</p>
            <p><sup>33</sup> for they rebelled against the Spirit of God, and rash words came from Moses' lips.</p>
            <p><sup>34</sup> They did not destroy the peoples as the Lord had commanded them,</p>
            <p><sup>35</sup> but they mingled with the nations and adopted their customs.</p>
            <p><sup>36</sup> They worshiped their idols, which became a snare to them.</p>
            <p><sup>37</sup> They sacrificed their sons and their daughters to false gods.</p>
            <p><sup>38</sup> They shed innocent blood, the blood of their sons and daughters, whom they sacrificed to the idols of Canaan, and the land was desecrated by their blood.</p>
            <p><sup>39</sup> They defiled themselves by what they did; by their deeds they prostituted themselves.</p>
            <p><sup>40</sup> Therefore the Lord was angry with his people and abhorred his inheritance.</p>
            <p><sup>41</sup> He gave them into the hands of the nations, and their foes ruled over them.</p>
            <p><sup>42</sup> Their enemies oppressed them and subjected them to their power.</p>
            <p><sup>43</sup> Many times he delivered them, but they were bent on rebellion and they wasted away in their sin.</p>
            <p><sup>44</sup> Yet he took note of their distress when he heard their cry;</p>
            <p><sup>45</sup> for their sake he remembered his covenant and out of his great love he relented.</p>
            <p><sup>46</sup> He caused all who held them captive to show them mercy.</p>
            <p><sup>47</sup> Save us, Lord our God, and gather us from the nations, that we may give thanks to your holy name and glory in your praise.</p>
            <p><sup>48</sup> Praise be to the Lord, the God of Israel, from everlasting to everlasting. Let all the people say, “Amen!” Praise the Lord.</p>
