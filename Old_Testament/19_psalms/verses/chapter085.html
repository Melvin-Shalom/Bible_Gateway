            <h4>For the director of music. Of the Sons of Korah. A psalm.</h4>
            <p><sup>1</sup> You, Lord, showed favor to your land; you restored the fortunes of Jacob.</p>
            <p><sup>2</sup> You forgave the iniquity of your people and covered all their sins.</p>
            <p><sup>3</sup> You set aside all your wrath and turned from your fierce anger.</p>
            <p><sup>4</sup> Restore us again, God our Savior, and put away your displeasure toward us.</p>
            <p><sup>5</sup> Will you be angry with us forever? Will you prolong your anger through all generations?</p>
            <p><sup>6</sup> Will you not revive us again, that your people may rejoice in you?</p>
            <p><sup>7</sup> Show us your unfailing love, Lord, and grant us your salvation.</p>
            <p><sup>8</sup> I will listen to what God the Lord says; he promises peace to his people, his faithful servantsâ€” but let them not turn to folly.</p>
            <p><sup>9</sup> Surely his salvation is near those who fear him, that his glory may dwell in our land.</p>
            <p><sup>10</sup> Love and faithfulness meet together; righteousness and peace kiss each other.</p>
            <p><sup>11</sup> Faithfulness springs forth from the earth, and righteousness looks down from heaven.</p>
            <p><sup>12</sup> The Lord will indeed give what is good, and our land will yield its harvest.</p>
            <p><sup>13</sup> Righteousness goes before him and prepares the way for his steps.</p>
