            <h4>For the director of music. According to sheminith. A psalm of David.</h4>
            <p><sup>1</sup> Help, Lord, for no one is faithful anymore; those who are loyal have vanished from the human race.</p>
            <p><sup>2</sup> Everyone lies to their neighbor; they flatter with their lips but harbor deception in their hearts.</p>
            <p><sup>3</sup> May the Lord silence all flattering lips and every boastful tongue—</p>
            <p><sup>4</sup> those who say, “By our tongues we will prevail; our own lips will defend us—who is lord over us?”</p>
            <p><sup>5</sup> “Because the poor are plundered and the needy groan, I will now arise,” says the Lord. “I will protect them from those who malign them.”</p>
            <p><sup>6</sup> And the words of the Lord are flawless, like silver purified in a crucible, like gold refined seven times.</p>
            <p><sup>7</sup> You, Lord, will keep the needy safe and will protect us forever from the wicked,</p>
            <p><sup>8</sup> who freely strut about when what is vile is honored by the human race.</p>
