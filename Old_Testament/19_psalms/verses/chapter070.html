            <h4>For the director of music. Of David. A petition.</h4>
            <p><sup>1</sup> Hasten, O God, to save me; come quickly, Lord, to help me.</p>
            <p><sup>2</sup> May those who want to take my life be put to shame and confusion; may all who desire my ruin be turned back in disgrace.</p>
            <p><sup>3</sup> May those who say to me, “Aha! Aha!” turn back because of their shame.</p>
            <p><sup>4</sup> But may all who seek you rejoice and be glad in you; may those who long for your saving help always say, “The Lord is great!”</p>
            <p><sup>5</sup> But as for me, I am poor and needy; come quickly to me, O God. You are my help and my deliverer; Lord, do not delay.</p>
