            <p><sup>1</sup> Sing to the Lord a new song, for he has done marvelous things; his right hand and his holy arm have worked salvation for him.</p>
            <p><sup>2</sup> The Lord has made his salvation known and revealed his righteousness to the nations.</p>
            <p><sup>3</sup> He has remembered his love and his faithfulness to Israel; all the ends of the earth have seen the salvation of our God.</p>
            <p><sup>4</sup> Shout for joy to the Lord, all the earth, burst into jubilant song with music;</p>
            <p><sup>5</sup> make music to the Lord with the harp, with the harp and the sound of singing,</p>
            <p><sup>6</sup> with trumpets and the blast of the ram’s horn— shout for joy before the Lord, the King.</p>
            <p><sup>7</sup> Let the sea resound, and everything in it, the world, and all who live in it.</p>
            <p><sup>8</sup> Let the rivers clap their hands, let the mountains sing together for joy;</p>
            <p><sup>9</sup> let them sing before the Lord, for he comes to judge the earth. He will judge the world in righteousness and the peoples with equity.</p>
