            <h4>A song. A psalm of David.</h4>
            <p><sup>1</sup> My heart, O God, is steadfast; I will sing and make music with all my soul.</p>
            <p><sup>2</sup> Awake, harp and lyre! I will awaken the dawn.</p>
            <p><sup>3</sup> I will praise you, Lord, among the nations; I will sing of you among the peoples.</p>
            <p><sup>4</sup> For great is your love, higher than the heavens; your faithfulness reaches to the skies.</p>
            <p><sup>5</sup> Be exalted, O God, above the heavens; let your glory be over all the earth.</p>
            <p><sup>6</sup> Save us and help us with your right hand, that those you love may be delivered.</p>
            <p><sup>7</sup> God has spoken from his sanctuary: “In triumph I will parcel out Shechem and measure off the Valley of Sukkoth.</p>
            <p><sup>8</sup> Gilead is mine, Manasseh is mine; Ephraim is my helmet, Judah is my scepter.</p>
            <p><sup>9</sup> Moab is my washbasin, on Edom I toss my sandal; over Philistia I shout in triumph.”</p>
            <p><sup>10</sup> Who will bring me to the fortified city? Who will lead me to Edom?</p>
            <p><sup>11</sup> Is it not you, God, you who have rejected us and no longer go out with our armies?</p>
            <p><sup>12</sup> Give us aid against the enemy, for human help is worthless.</p>
            <p><sup>13</sup> With God we will gain the victory, and he will trample down our enemies.</p>
