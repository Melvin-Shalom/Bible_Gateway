            <h4>For the director of music. With stringed instruments. A maskil of David.</h4>
            <p><sup>1</sup> Listen to my prayer, O God, do not ignore my plea; hear me and answer me.</p>
            <p><sup>2</sup> My thoughts trouble me and I am distraught because of what my enemy is saying, because of the threats of the wicked; for they bring down suffering on me and assail me in their anger.</p>
            <p><sup>3</sup> My heart is in anguish within me; the terrors of death have fallen on me.</p>
            <p><sup>4</sup> Fear and trembling have beset me; horror has overwhelmed me.</p>
            <p><sup>5</sup> I said, “Oh, that I had the wings of a dove! I would fly away and be at rest.</p>
            <p><sup>6</sup> I would flee far away and stay in the desert;</p>
            <p><sup>7</sup> I would hurry to my place of shelter, far from the tempest and storm.”</p>
            <p><sup>8</sup> Lord, confuse the wicked, confound their words, for I see violence and strife in the city.</p>
            <p><sup>9</sup> Day and night they prowl about on its walls; malice and abuse are within it.</p>
            <p><sup>10</sup> Destructive forces are at work in the city; threats and lies never leave its streets.</p>
            <p><sup>11</sup> If an enemy were insulting me, I could endure it; if a foe were rising against me, I could hide.</p>
            <p><sup>12</sup> But it is you, a man like myself, my companion, my close friend,</p>
            <p><sup>13</sup> with whom I once enjoyed sweet fellowship at the house of God, as we walked about among the worshipers.</p>
            <p><sup>14</sup> Let death take my enemies by surprise; let them go down alive to the realm of the dead, for evil finds lodging among them.</p>
            <p><sup>15</sup> As for me, I call to God, and the Lord saves me.</p>
            <p><sup>16</sup> Evening, morning and noon I cry out in distress, and he hears my voice.</p>
            <p><sup>17</sup> He rescues me unharmed from the battle waged against me, even though many oppose me.</p>
            <p><sup>18</sup> God, who is enthroned from of old, who does not change—he will hear them and humble them, because they have no fear of God.</p>
            <p><sup>19</sup> My companion attacks his friends; he violates his covenant.</p>
            <p><sup>20</sup> His talk is smooth as butter, yet war is in his heart; his words are more soothing than oil, yet they are drawn swords.</p>
            <p><sup>21</sup> Cast your cares on the Lord and he will sustain you; he will never let the righteous be shaken.</p>
            <p><sup>22</sup> But you, God, will bring down the wicked into the pit of decay; the bloodthirsty and deceitful will not live out half their days.</p>
            <p>But as for me, I trust in you.</p>
