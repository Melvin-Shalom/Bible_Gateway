            <h4>Of David.</h4>
            <p><sup>1</sup> In you, Lord my God, I put my trust.</p>
            <p><sup>2</sup> I trust in you; do not let me be put to shame, nor let my enemies triumph over me.</p>
            <p><sup>3</sup> No one who hopes in you will ever be put to shame, but shame will come on those who are treacherous without cause.</p>
            <p><sup>4</sup> Show me your ways, Lord, teach me your paths.</p>
            <p><sup>5</sup> Guide me in your truth and teach me, for you are God my Savior, and my hope is in you all day long.</p>
            <p><sup>6</sup> Remember, Lord, your great mercy and love, for they are from of old.</p>
            <p><sup>7</sup> Do not remember the sins of my youth and my rebellious ways; according to your love remember me, for you, Lord, are good.</p>
            <p><sup>8</sup> Good and upright is the Lord; therefore he instructs sinners in his ways.</p>
            <p><sup>9</sup> He guides the humble in what is right and teaches them his way.</p>
            <p><sup>10</sup> All the ways of the Lord are loving and faithful toward those who keep the demands of his covenant.</p>
            <p><sup>11</sup> For the sake of your name, Lord, forgive my iniquity, though it is great.</p>
            <p><sup>12</sup> Who, then, are those who fear the Lord? He will instruct them in the ways they should choose.</p>
            <p><sup>13</sup> They will spend their days in prosperity, and their descendants will inherit the land.</p>
            <p><sup>14</sup> The Lord confides in those who fear him; he makes his covenant known to them.</p>
            <p><sup>15</sup> My eyes are ever on the Lord, for only he will release my feet from the snare.</p>
            <p><sup>16</sup> Turn to me and be gracious to me, for I am lonely and afflicted.</p>
            <p><sup>17</sup> Relieve the troubles of my heart and free me from my anguish.</p>
            <p><sup>18</sup> Look on my affliction and my distress and take away all my sins.</p>
            <p><sup>19</sup> See how numerous are my enemies and how fiercely they hate me!</p>
            <p><sup>20</sup> Guard my life and rescue me; do not let me be put to shame, for I take refuge in you.</p>
            <p><sup>21</sup> May integrity and uprightness protect me, because my hope, Lord, is in you.</p>
            <p><sup>22</sup> Deliver Israel, O God, from all their troubles!</p>
