        <div>
            <p><sup>1</sup> Why do the nations conspire and the peoples plot in vain?</p>
            <p><sup>2</sup> The kings of the earth rise up and the rulers band together against the Lord and against his anointed, saying,</p>
            <p><sup>3</sup> “Let us break their chains and throw off their shackles.”</p>
            <p><sup>4</sup> The One enthroned in heaven laughs; the Lord scoffs at them.</p>
            <p><sup>5</sup> He rebukes them in his anger and terrifies them in his wrath, saying,</p>
            <p><sup>6</sup> “I have installed my king on Zion, my holy mountain.”</p>
            <p><sup>7</sup> I will proclaim the Lord’s decree: He said to me, “You are my son; today I have become your father.</p>
            <p><sup>8</sup> Ask me, and I will make the nations your inheritance, the ends of the earth your possession.</p>
            <p><sup>9</sup> You will break them with a rod of iron; you will dash them to pieces like pottery.”</p>
            <p><sup>10</sup> Therefore, you kings, be wise; be warned, you rulers of the earth.</p>
            <p><sup>11</sup> Serve the Lord with fear and celebrate his rule with trembling.</p>
            <p><sup>12</sup> Kiss his son, or he will be angry and your way will lead to your destruction, for his wrath can flare up in a moment. Blessed are all who take refuge in him.</p>
