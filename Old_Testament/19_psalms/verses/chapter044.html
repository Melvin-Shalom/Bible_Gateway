            <h4>For the director of music. Of the Sons of Korah. A maskil.</h4>
            <p><sup>1</sup> We have heard it with our ears, O God; our ancestors have told us what you did in their days, in days long ago.</p>
            <p><sup>2</sup> With your hand you drove out the nations and planted our ancestors; you crushed the peoples and made our ancestors flourish.</p>
            <p><sup>3</sup> It was not by their sword that they won the land, nor did their arm bring them victory; it was your right hand, your arm, and the light of your face, for you loved them.</p>
            <p><sup>4</sup> You are my King and my God, who decrees victories for Jacob.</p>
            <p><sup>5</sup> Through you we push back our enemies; through your name we trample our foes.</p>
            <p><sup>6</sup> I put no trust in my bow, my sword does not bring me victory;</p>
            <p><sup>7</sup> but you give us victory over our enemies, you put our adversaries to shame.</p>
            <p><sup>8</sup> In God we make our boast all day long, and we will praise your name forever.</p>
            <p><sup>9</sup> But now you have rejected and humbled us; you no longer go out with our armies.</p>
            <p><sup>10</sup> You made us retreat before the enemy, and our adversaries have plundered us.</p>
            <p><sup>11</sup> You gave us up to be devoured like sheep and have scattered us among the nations.</p>
            <p><sup>12</sup> You sold your people for a pittance, gaining nothing from their sale.</p>
            <p><sup>13</sup> You have made us a reproach to our neighbors, the scorn and derision of those around us.</p>
            <p><sup>14</sup> You have made us a byword among the nations; the peoples shake their heads at us.</p>
            <p><sup>15</sup> I live in disgrace all day long, and my face is covered with shame</p>
            <p><sup>16</sup> at the taunts of those who reproach and revile me, because of the enemy, who is bent on revenge.</p>
            <p><sup>17</sup> All this came upon us, though we had not forgotten you; we had not been false to your covenant.</p>
            <p><sup>18</sup> Our hearts had not turned back; our feet had not strayed from your path.</p>
            <p><sup>19</sup> But you crushed us and made us a haunt for jackals; you covered us over with deep darkness.</p>
            <p><sup>20</sup> If we had forgotten the name of our God or spread out our hands to a foreign god,</p>
            <p><sup>21</sup> would not God have discovered it, since he knows the secrets of the heart?</p>
            <p><sup>22</sup> Yet for your sake we face death all day long; we are considered as sheep to be slaughtered.</p>
            <p><sup>23</sup> Awake, Lord! Why do you sleep? Rouse yourself! Do not reject us forever.</p>
            <p><sup>24</sup> Why do you hide your face and forget our misery and oppression?</p>
            <p><sup>25</sup> We are brought down to the dust; our bodies cling to the ground.</p>
            <p><sup>26</sup> Rise up and help us; rescue us because of your unfailing love.</p>
