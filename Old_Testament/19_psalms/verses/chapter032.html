            <h4>Of David. A maskil.</h4>
            <p><sup>1</sup> Blessed is the one whose transgressions are forgiven, whose sins are covered.</p>
            <p><sup>2</sup> Blessed is the one whose sin the Lord does not count against them and in whose spirit is no deceit.</p>
            <p><sup>3</sup> When I kept silent, my bones wasted away through my groaning all day long.</p>
            <p><sup>4</sup> For day and night your hand was heavy on me; my strength was sapped as in the heat of summer.</p>
            <p><sup>5</sup> Then I acknowledged my sin to you and did not cover up my iniquity. I said, “I will confess my transgressions to the Lord.” And you forgave the guilt of my sin.</p>
            <p><sup>6</sup> Therefore let all the faithful pray to you while you may be found; surely the rising of the mighty waters will not reach them.</p>
            <p><sup>7</sup> You are my hiding place; you will protect me from trouble and surround me with songs of deliverance.</p>
            <p><sup>8</sup> I will instruct you and teach you in the way you should go; I will counsel you with my loving eye on you.</p>
            <p><sup>9</sup> Do not be like the horse or the mule, which have no understanding but must be controlled by bit and bridle or they will not come to you.</p>
            <p><sup>10</sup> Many are the woes of the wicked, but the Lord’s unfailing love surrounds the one who trusts in him.</p>
            <p><sup>11</sup> Rejoice in the Lord and be glad, you righteous; sing, all you who are upright in heart!</p>
