            <h4>Of David. A psalm.</h4>
            <p><sup>1</sup> The earth is the Lord’s, and everything in it, the world, and all who live in it;</p>
            <p><sup>2</sup> for he founded it on the seas and established it on the waters.</p>
            <p><sup>3</sup> Who may ascend the mountain of the Lord? Who may stand in his holy place?</p>
            <p><sup>4</sup> The one who has clean hands and a pure heart, who does not trust in an idol or swear by a false god.</p>
            <p><sup>5</sup> They will receive blessing from the Lord and vindication from God their Savior.</p>
            <p><sup>6</sup> Such is the generation of those who seek him, who seek your face, God of Jacob.</p>
            <p><sup>7</sup> Lift up your heads, you gates; be lifted up, you ancient doors, that the King of glory may come in.</p>
            <p><sup>8</sup> Who is this King of glory? The Lord strong and mighty, the Lord mighty in battle.</p>
            <p><sup>9</sup> Lift up your heads, you gates; lift them up, you ancient doors, that the King of glory may come in.</p>
            <p><sup>10</sup> Who is he, this King of glory? The Lord Almighty— he is the King of glory.</p>
