            <h4>For the director of music. To the tune of “Do Not Destroy.” A psalm of Asaph. A song.</h4>
            <p><sup>1</sup> We praise you, God, we praise you, for your Name is near; people tell of your wonderful deeds.</p>
            <p><sup>2</sup> You say, “I choose the appointed time; it is I who judge uprightly.</p>
            <p><sup>3</sup> When the earth and all its people quake, it is I who hold its pillars firm.</p>
            <p><sup>4</sup> To the arrogant I say, ‘Boast no more,’ and to the wicked, ‘Do not lift up your horns.</p>
            <p><sup>5</sup> Do not lift your horns against heaven; do not speak so defiantly.’”</p>
            <p><sup>6</sup> No one from the east or the west or from the desert can exalt themselves.</p>
            <p><sup>7</sup> It is God who judges: He brings one down, he exalts another.</p>
            <p><sup>8</sup> In the hand of the Lord is a cup full of foaming wine mixed with spices; he pours it out, and all the wicked of the earth drink it down to its very dregs.</p>
            <p><sup>9</sup> As for me, I will declare this forever; I will sing praise to the God of Jacob.</p>
            <p><sup>10</sup> I will cut off the horns of all the wicked, but the horns of the righteous will be lifted up.</p>
