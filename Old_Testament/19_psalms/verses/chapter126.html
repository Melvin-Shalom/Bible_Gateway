            <h4>A song of ascents.</h4>
            <p><sup>1</sup> When the Lord restored the fortunes of Zion, we were like those who dreamed.</p>
            <p><sup>2</sup> Our mouths were filled with laughter, our tongues with songs of joy. Then it was said among the nations, “The Lord has done great things for them.”</p>
            <p><sup>3</sup> The Lord has done great things for us, and we are filled with joy.</p>
            <p><sup>4</sup> Restore our fortunes, Lord, like streams in the Negev.</p>
            <p><sup>5</sup> Those who sow with tears will reap with songs of joy.</p>
            <p><sup>6</sup> Those who go out weeping, carrying seed to sow, will return with songs of joy, carrying sheaves with them.</p>
