        <div>
            <p><sup>1</sup> Praise the Lord. Praise the Lord from the heavens; praise him in the heights above.</p>
            <p><sup>2</sup> Praise him, all his angels; praise him, all his heavenly hosts.</p>
            <p><sup>3</sup> Praise him, sun and moon; praise him, all you shining stars.</p>
            <p><sup>4</sup> Praise him, you highest heavens and you waters above the skies.</p>
            <p><sup>5</sup> Let them praise the name of the Lord, for at his command they were created.</p>
            <p><sup>6</sup> And he established them forever and everâ€”he issued a decree that will never pass away.</p>
            <p><sup>7</sup> Praise the Lord from the earth, you great sea creatures and all ocean depths.</p>
            <p><sup>8</sup> Lightning and hail, snow and clouds, stormy winds that do his bidding.</p>
            <p><sup>9</sup> You mountains and all hills, fruit trees and all cedars.</p>
            <p><sup>10</sup> Wild animals and all cattle, small creatures and flying birds.</p>
            <p><sup>11</sup> Kings of the earth and all nations, you princes and all rulers on earth.</p>
            <p><sup>12</sup> Young men and women, old men and children.</p>
            <p><sup>13</sup> Let them praise the name of the Lord, for his name alone is exalted; his splendor is above the earth and the heavens.</p>
            <p><sup>14</sup> And he has raised up for his people a horn, the praise of all his faithful servants, of Israel, the people close to his heart.</p>
            <p>Praise the Lord.</p>
