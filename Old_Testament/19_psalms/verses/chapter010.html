        <h1>Psalm 10</h1>
    </header><main>
        <div>
            <p><sup>1</sup> Why, Lord, do you stand far off? Why do you hide yourself in times of trouble?</p>
            <p><sup>2</sup> In his arrogance the wicked man hunts down the weak, who are caught in the schemes he devises.</p>
            <p><sup>3</sup> He boasts about the cravings of his heart; he blesses the greedy and reviles the Lord.</p>
            <p><sup>4</sup> In his pride the wicked man does not seek him; in all his thoughts there is no room for God.</p>
            <p><sup>5</sup> His ways are always prosperous; your laws are rejected by him; he sneers at all his enemies.</p>
            <p><sup>6</sup> He says to himself, “Nothing will ever shake me.” He swears, “No one will ever do me harm.”</p>
            <p><sup>7</sup> His mouth is full of lies and threats; trouble and evil are under his tongue.</p>
            <p><sup>8</sup> He lies in wait near the villages; from ambush he murders the innocent. His eyes watch in secret for his victims;</p>
            <p><sup>9</sup> like a lion in cover he lies in wait. He lies in wait to catch the helpless; he catches the helpless and drags them off in his net.</p>
            <p><sup>10</sup> His victims are crushed, they collapse; they fall under his strength.</p>
            <p><sup>11</sup> He says to himself, “God will never notice; he covers his face and never sees.”</p>
            <p><sup>12</sup> Arise, Lord! Lift up your hand, O God. Do not forget the helpless.</p>
            <p><sup>13</sup> Why does the wicked man revile God? Why does he say to himself, “He won’t call me to account”?</p>
            <p><sup>14</sup> But you, God, see the trouble of the afflicted; you consider their grief and take it in hand. The victims commit themselves to you; you are the helper of the fatherless.</p>
            <p><sup>15</sup> Break the arm of the wicked man; call the evildoer to account for his wickedness that would not otherwise be found out.</p>
            <p><sup>16</sup> The Lord is King for ever and ever; the nations will perish from his land.</p>
            <p><sup>17</sup> You, Lord, hear the desire of the afflicted; you encourage them, and you listen to their cry,</p>
            <p><sup>18</sup> defending the fatherless and the oppressed, so that mere earthly mortals will never again strike terror.</p>
