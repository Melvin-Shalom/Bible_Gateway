            <p><sup>1</sup> Praise the Lord. I will extol the Lord with all my heart in the council of the upright and in the assembly.</p>
            <p><sup>2</sup> Great are the works of the Lord; they are pondered by all who delight in them.</p>
            <p><sup>3</sup> Glorious and majestic are his deeds, and his righteousness endures forever.</p>
            <p><sup>4</sup> He has caused his wonders to be remembered; the Lord is gracious and compassionate.</p>
            <p><sup>5</sup> He provides food for those who fear him; he remembers his covenant forever.</p>
            <p><sup>6</sup> He has shown his people the power of his works, giving them the lands of other nations.</p>
            <p><sup>7</sup> The works of his hands are faithful and just; all his precepts are trustworthy.</p>
            <p><sup>8</sup> They are established for ever and ever, enacted in faithfulness and uprightness.</p>
            <p><sup>9</sup> He provided redemption for his people; he ordained his covenant foreverâ€”holy and awesome is his name.</p>
            <p><sup>10</sup> The fear of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom; all who follow his precepts have good understanding. To him belongs eternal praise.</p>
