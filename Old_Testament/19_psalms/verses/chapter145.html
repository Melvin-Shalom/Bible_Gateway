            <h4>A psalm of praise. Of David.</h4>
            <p><sup>1</sup> I will exalt you, my God the King; I will praise your name for ever and ever.</p>
            <p><sup>2</sup> Every day I will praise you and extol your name for ever and ever.</p>
            <p><sup>3</sup> Great is the Lord and most worthy of praise; his greatness no one can fathom.</p>
            <p><sup>4</sup> One generation commends your works to another; they tell of your mighty acts.</p>
            <p><sup>5</sup> They speak of the glorious splendor of your majesty—and I will meditate on your wonderful works.</p>
            <p><sup>6</sup> They tell of the power of your awesome works—and I will proclaim your great deeds.</p>
            <p><sup>7</sup> They celebrate your abundant goodness and joyfully sing of your righteousness.</p>
            <p><sup>8</sup> The Lord is gracious and compassionate, slow to anger and rich in love.</p>
            <p><sup>9</sup> The Lord is good to all; he has compassion on all he has made.</p>
            <p><sup>10</sup> All your works praise you, Lord; your faithful people extol you.</p>
            <p><sup>11</sup> They tell of the glory of your kingdom and speak of your might,</p>
            <p><sup>12</sup> so that all people may know of your mighty acts and the glorious splendor of your kingdom.</p>
            <p><sup>13</sup> Your kingdom is an everlasting kingdom, and your dominion endures through all generations. The Lord is trustworthy in all he promises and faithful in all he does.</p>
            <p><sup>14</sup> The Lord upholds all who fall and lifts up all who are bowed down.</p>
            <p><sup>15</sup> The eyes of all look to you, and you give them their food at the proper time.</p>
            <p><sup>16</sup> You open your hand and satisfy the desires of every living thing.</p>
            <p><sup>17</sup> The Lord is righteous in all his ways and faithful in all he does.</p>
            <p><sup>18</sup> The Lord is near to all who call on him, to all who call on him in truth.</p>
            <p><sup>19</sup> He fulfills the desires of those who fear him; he hears their cry and saves them.</p>
            <p><sup>20</sup> The Lord watches over all who love him, but all the wicked he will destroy.</p>
            <p><sup>21</sup> My mouth will speak in praise of the Lord. Let every creature praise his holy name for ever and ever.</p>
