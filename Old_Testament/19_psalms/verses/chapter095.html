            <p><sup>1</sup> Come, let us sing for joy to the Lord; let us shout aloud to the Rock of our salvation.</p>
            <p><sup>2</sup> Let us come before him with thanksgiving and extol him with music and song.</p>
            <p><sup>3</sup> For the Lord is the great God, the great King above all gods.</p>
            <p><sup>4</sup> In his hand are the depths of the earth, and the mountain peaks belong to him.</p>
            <p><sup>5</sup> The sea is his, for he made it, and his hands formed the dry land.</p>
            <p><sup>6</sup> Come, let us bow down in worship, let us kneel before the Lord our Maker;</p>
            <p><sup>7</sup> for he is our God and we are the people of his pasture, the flock under his care.</p>
            <p><sup>8</sup> Today, if only you would hear his voice, “Do not harden your hearts as you did at Meribah, as you did that day at Massah in the wilderness,</p>
            <p><sup>9</sup> where your ancestors tested me; they tried me, though they had seen what I did.</p>
            <p><sup>10</sup> For forty years I was angry with that generation; I said, ‘They are a people whose hearts go astray, and they have not known my ways.’</p>
            <p><sup>11</sup> So I declared on oath in my anger, ‘They shall never enter my rest.’”</p>
