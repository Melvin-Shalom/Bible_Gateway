            <h4>Of David. When he pretended to be insane before Abimelek, who drove him away, and he left.</h4>
            <p><sup>1</sup> I will extol the Lord at all times; his praise will always be on my lips.</p>
            <p><sup>2</sup> I will glory in the Lord; let the afflicted hear and rejoice.</p>
            <p><sup>3</sup> Glorify the Lord with me; let us exalt his name together.</p>
            <p><sup>4</sup> I sought the Lord, and he answered me; he delivered me from all my fears.</p>
            <p><sup>5</sup> Those who look to him are radiant; their faces are never covered with shame.</p>
            <p><sup>6</sup> This poor man called, and the Lord heard him; he saved him out of all his troubles.</p>
            <p><sup>7</sup> The angel of the Lord encamps around those who fear him, and he delivers them.</p>
            <p><sup>8</sup> Taste and see that the Lord is good; blessed is the one who takes refuge in him.</p>
            <p><sup>9</sup> Fear the Lord, you his holy people, for those who fear him lack nothing.</p>
            <p><sup>10</sup> The lions may grow weak and hungry, but those who seek the Lord lack no good thing.</p>
            <p><sup>11</sup> Come, my children, listen to me; I will teach you the fear of the Lord.</p>
            <p><sup>12</sup> Whoever of you loves life and desires to see many good days,</p>
            <p><sup>13</sup> keep your tongue from evil and your lips from telling lies.</p>
            <p><sup>14</sup> Turn from evil and do good; seek peace and pursue it.</p>
            <p><sup>15</sup> The eyes of the Lord are on the righteous, and his ears are attentive to their cry;</p>
            <p><sup>16</sup> but the face of the Lord is against those who do evil, to blot out their name from the earth.</p>
            <p><sup>17</sup> The righteous cry out, and the Lord hears them; he delivers them from all their troubles.</p>
            <p><sup>18</sup> The Lord is close to the brokenhearted and saves those who are crushed in spirit.</p>
            <p><sup>19</sup> The righteous person may have many troubles, but the Lord delivers him from them all;</p>
            <p><sup>20</sup> he protects all his bones, not one of them will be broken.</p>
            <p><sup>21</sup> Evil will slay the wicked; the foes of the righteous will be condemned.</p>
            <p><sup>22</sup> The Lord will rescue his servants; no one who takes refuge in him will be condemned.</p>
