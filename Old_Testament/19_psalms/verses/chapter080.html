            <h4>For the director of music. To the tune of “The Lilies of the Covenant.” Of Asaph. A psalm.</h4>
            <p><sup>1</sup> Hear us, Shepherd of Israel, you who lead Joseph like a flock. You who sit enthroned between the cherubim, shine forth</p>
            <p><sup>2</sup> before Ephraim, Benjamin and Manasseh. Awaken your might; come and save us.</p>
            <p><sup>3</sup> Restore us, O God; make your face shine on us, that we may be saved.</p>
            <p><sup>4</sup> How long, Lord God Almighty, will your anger smolder against the prayers of your people?</p>
            <p><sup>5</sup> You have fed them with the bread of tears; you have made them drink tears by the bowlful.</p>
            <p><sup>6</sup> You have made us an object of derision to our neighbors, and our enemies mock us.</p>
            <p><sup>7</sup> Restore us, God Almighty; make your face shine on us, that we may be saved.</p>
            <p><sup>8</sup> You transplanted a vine from Egypt; you drove out the nations and planted it.</p>
            <p><sup>9</sup> You cleared the ground for it, and it took root and filled the land.</p>
            <p><sup>10</sup> The mountains were covered with its shade, the mighty cedars with its branches.</p>
            <p><sup>11</sup> Its branches reached as far as the Sea, its shoots as far as the River.</p>
            <p><sup>12</sup> Why have you broken down its walls so that all who pass by pick its grapes?</p>
            <p><sup>13</sup> Boars from the forest ravage it, and insects from the fields feed on it.</p>
            <p><sup>14</sup> Return to us, God Almighty! Look down from heaven and see! Watch over this vine,</p>
            <p><sup>15</sup> the root your right hand has planted, the son you have raised up for yourself.</p>
            <p><sup>16</sup> Your vine is cut down, it is burned with fire; at your rebuke your people perish.</p>
            <p><sup>17</sup> Let your hand rest on the man at your right hand, the son of man you have raised up for yourself.</p>
            <p><sup>18</sup> Then we will not turn away from you; revive us, and we will call on your name.</p>
            <p><sup>19</sup> Restore us, Lord God Almighty; make your face shine on us, that we may be saved.</p>
