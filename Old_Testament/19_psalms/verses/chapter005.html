            <h4>For the director of music. For pipes. A psalm of David</h4>
            <p><sup>1</sup> Listen to my words, Lord, consider my lament.</p>
            <p><sup>2</sup> Hear my cry for help, my King and my God, for to you I pray.</p>
            <p><sup>3</sup> In the morning, Lord, you hear my voice; in the morning I lay my requests before you and wait expectantly.</p>
            <p><sup>4</sup> For you are not a God who is pleased with wickedness; with you, evil people are not welcome.</p>
            <p><sup>5</sup> The arrogant cannot stand in your presence. You hate all who do wrong;</p>
            <p><sup>6</sup> you destroy those who tell lies. The bloodthirsty and deceitful you, Lord, detest.</p>
            <p><sup>7</sup> But I, by your great love, can come into your house; in reverence I bow down toward your holy temple.</p>
            <p><sup>8</sup> Lead me, Lord, in your righteousness because of my enemiesâ€” make your way straight before me.</p>
            <p><sup>9</sup> Not a word from their mouth can be trusted; their heart is filled with malice. Their throat is an open grave; with their tongues they tell lies.</p>
            <p><sup>10</sup> Declare them guilty, O God! Let their intrigues be their downfall. Banish them for their many sins, for they have rebelled against you.</p>
            <p><sup>11</sup> But let all who take refuge in you be glad; let them ever sing for joy. Spread your protection over them, that those who love your name may rejoice in you.</p>
            <p><sup>12</sup> Surely, Lord, you bless the righteous; you surround them with your favor as with a shield.</p>
