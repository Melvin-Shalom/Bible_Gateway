            <h4>For the director of music. Of the Sons of Korah. A psalm.</h4>
            <p><sup>1</sup> Hear this, all you peoples; listen, all who live in this world,</p>
            <p><sup>2</sup> both low and high, rich and poor alike:</p>
            <p><sup>3</sup> My mouth will speak words of wisdom; the meditation of my heart will give you understanding.</p>
            <p><sup>4</sup> I will turn my ear to a proverb; with the harp I will expound my riddle:</p>
            <p><sup>5</sup> Why should I fear when evil days come, when wicked deceivers surround me—</p>
            <p><sup>6</sup> those who trust in their wealth and boast of their great riches?</p>
            <p><sup>7</sup> No one can redeem the life of another or give to God a ransom for them—</p>
            <p><sup>8</sup> the ransom for a life is costly, no payment is ever enough—</p>
            <p><sup>9</sup> so that they should live on forever and not see decay.</p>
            <p><sup>10</sup> For all can see that the wise die, that the foolish and the senseless also perish, leaving their wealth to others.</p>
            <p><sup>11</sup> Their tombs will remain their houses forever, their dwellings for endless generations, though they had named lands after themselves.</p>
            <p><sup>12</sup> People, despite their wealth, do not endure; they are like the beasts that perish.</p>
            <p><sup>13</sup> This is the fate of those who trust in themselves, and of their followers, who approve their sayings.</p>
            <p><sup>14</sup> They are like sheep and are destined to die; death will be their shepherd. But the upright will prevail over them in the morning; their forms will decay in the grave, far from their princely mansions.</p>
            <p><sup>15</sup> But God will redeem me from the realm of the dead; he will surely take me to himself.</p>
            <p><sup>16</sup> Do not be overawed when others grow rich, when the splendor of their houses increases;</p>
            <p><sup>17</sup> for they will take nothing with them when they die, their splendor will not descend with them.</p>
            <p><sup>18</sup> Though while they live they count themselves blessed—and people praise you when you prosper—</p>
            <p><sup>19</sup> they will join those who have gone before them, who will never again see the light of life.</p>
            <p><sup>20</sup> People who have wealth but lack understanding are like the beasts that perish.</p>
