            <h4>A psalm of Asaph.</h4>
            <p><sup>1</sup> The Mighty One, God, the Lord, speaks and summons the earth from the rising of the sun to where it sets.</p>
            <p><sup>2</sup> From Zion, perfect in beauty, God shines forth.</p>
            <p><sup>3</sup> Our God comes and will not be silent; a fire devours before him, and around him a tempest rages.</p>
            <p><sup>4</sup> He summons the heavens above, and the earth, that he may judge his people:</p>
            <p><sup>5</sup> “Gather to me this consecrated people, who made a covenant with me by sacrifice.”</p>
            <p><sup>6</sup> And the heavens proclaim his righteousness, for he is a God of justice.</p>
            <p><sup>7</sup> “Listen, my people, and I will speak; I will testify against you, Israel: I am God, your God.</p>
            <p><sup>8</sup> I bring no charges against you concerning your sacrifices or concerning your burnt offerings, which are ever before me.</p>
            <p><sup>9</sup> I have no need of a bull from your stall or of goats from your pens,</p>
            <p><sup>10</sup> for every animal of the forest is mine, and the cattle on a thousand hills.</p>
            <p><sup>11</sup> I know every bird in the mountains, and the insects in the fields are mine.</p>
            <p><sup>12</sup> If I were hungry I would not tell you, for the world is mine, and all that is in it.</p>
            <p><sup>13</sup> Do I eat the flesh of bulls or drink the blood of goats?</p>
            <p><sup>14</sup> Sacrifice thank offerings to God, fulfill your vows to the Most High,</p>
            <p><sup>15</sup> and call on me in the day of trouble; I will deliver you, and you will honor me.”</p>
            <p><sup>16</sup> But to the wicked person God says: “What right have you to recite my laws or take my covenant on your lips?</p>
            <p><sup>17</sup> You hate my instruction and cast my words behind you.</p>
            <p><sup>18</sup> When you see a thief, you join with him; you throw in your lot with adulterers.</p>
            <p><sup>19</sup> You use your mouth for evil and harness your tongue to deceit.</p>
            <p><sup>20</sup> You sit and testify against your brother and slander your own mother’s son.</p>
            <p><sup>21</sup> When you did these things and I kept silent, you thought I was exactly like you. But I now arraign you and set my accusations before you.</p>
            <p><sup>22</sup> Consider this, you who forget God, or I will tear you to pieces, with no one to rescue you:</p>
            <p><sup>23</sup> Those who sacrifice thank offerings honor me, and to the blameless I will show my salvation.”</p>
