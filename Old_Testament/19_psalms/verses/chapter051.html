            <h4>For the director of music. A psalm of David. When the prophet Nathan came to him after David had committed adultery with Bathsheba.</h4>
            <p><sup>1</sup> Have mercy on me, O God, according to your unfailing love; according to your great compassion blot out my transgressions.</p>
            <p><sup>2</sup> Wash away all my iniquity and cleanse me from my sin.</p>
            <p><sup>3</sup> For I know my transgressions, and my sin is always before me.</p>
            <p><sup>4</sup> Against you, you only, have I sinned and done what is evil in your sight; so you are right in your verdict and justified when you judge.</p>
            <p><sup>5</sup> Surely I was sinful at birth, sinful from the time my mother conceived me.</p>
            <p><sup>6</sup> Yet you desired faithfulness even in the womb; you taught me wisdom in that secret place.</p>
            <p><sup>7</sup> Cleanse me with hyssop, and I will be clean; wash me, and I will be whiter than snow.</p>
            <p><sup>8</sup> Let me hear joy and gladness; let the bones you have crushed rejoice.</p>
            <p><sup>9</sup> Hide your face from my sins and blot out all my iniquity.</p>
            <p><sup>10</sup> Create in me a pure heart, O God, and renew a steadfast spirit within me.</p>
            <p><sup>11</sup> Do not cast me from your presence or take your Holy Spirit from me.</p>
            <p><sup>12</sup> Restore to me the joy of your salvation and grant me a willing spirit, to sustain me.</p>
            <p><sup>13</sup> Then I will teach transgressors your ways, so that sinners will turn back to you.</p>
            <p><sup>14</sup> Deliver me from the guilt of bloodshed, O God, you who are God my Savior, and my tongue will sing of your righteousness.</p>
            <p><sup>15</sup> Open my lips, Lord, and my mouth will declare your praise.</p>
            <p><sup>16</sup> You do not delight in sacrifice, or I would bring it; you do not take pleasure in burnt offerings.</p>
            <p><sup>17</sup> My sacrifice, O God, is a broken spirit; a broken and contrite heart you, God, will not despise.</p>
            <p><sup>18</sup> May it please you to prosper Zion, to build up the walls of Jerusalem.</p>
            <p><sup>19</sup> Then you will delight in the sacrifices of the righteous, in burnt offerings offered whole; then bulls will be offered on your altar.</p>
