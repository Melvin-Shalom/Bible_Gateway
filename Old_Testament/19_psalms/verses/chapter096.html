        <div>
            <p><sup>1</sup> Sing to the Lord a new song;</p>
            <p> sing to the Lord, all the earth.</p>
            <p><sup>2</sup> Sing to the Lord, praise his name; proclaim his salvation day after day.</p>
            <p><sup>3</sup> Declare his glory among the nations, his marvelous deeds among all peoples.</p>
            <p><sup>4</sup> For great is the Lord and most worthy of praise; he is to be feared above all gods.</p>
            <p><sup>5</sup> For all the gods of the nations are idols, but the Lord made the heavens.</p>
            <p><sup>6</sup> Splendor and majesty are before him; strength and glory are in his sanctuary.</p>
            <p><sup>7</sup> Ascribe to the Lord, all you families of nations, ascribe to the Lord glory and strength.</p>
            <p><sup>8</sup> Ascribe to the Lord the glory due his name; bring an offering and come into his courts.</p>
            <p><sup>9</sup> Worship the Lord in the splendor of his holiness; tremble before him, all the earth.</p>
            <p><sup>10</sup> Say among the nations, “The Lord reigns.” The world is firmly established, it cannot be moved; he will judge the peoples with equity.</p>
            <p><sup>11</sup> Let the heavens rejoice, let the earth be glad; let the sea resound, and all that is in it.</p>
            <p><sup>12</sup> Let the fields be jubilant, and everything in them; let all the trees of the forest sing for joy.</p>
            <p><sup>13</sup> Let all creation rejoice before the Lord, for he comes, he comes to judge the earth. He will judge the world in righteousness and the peoples in his faithfulness.</p>
