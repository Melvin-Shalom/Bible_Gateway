            <h4>A song of ascents. Of David.</h4>
            <p><sup>1</sup> If the Lord had not been on our side—let Israel say—</p>
            <p><sup>2</sup> if the Lord had not been on our side when people attacked us,</p>
            <p><sup>3</sup> they would have swallowed us alive when their anger flared against us;</p>
            <p><sup>4</sup> the flood would have engulfed us, the torrent would have swept over us,</p>
            <p><sup>5</sup> the raging waters would have swept us away.</p>
            <p><sup>6</sup> Praise be to the Lord, who has not let us be torn by their teeth.</p>
            <p><sup>7</sup> We have escaped like a bird from the fowler’s snare; the snare has been broken, and we have escaped.</p>
            <p><sup>8</sup> Our help is in the name of the Lord, the Maker of heaven and earth.</p>
