            <h4>A song. A psalm of Asaph.</h4>
            <p><sup>1</sup> O God, do not remain silent; do not turn a deaf ear, do not stand aloof, O God.</p>
            <p><sup>2</sup> See how your enemies growl, how your foes rear their heads.</p>
            <p><sup>3</sup> With cunning they conspire against your people; they plot against those you cherish.</p>
            <p><sup>4</sup> “Come,” they say, “let us destroy them as a nation, so that Israel’s name is remembered no more.”</p>
            <p><sup>5</sup> With one mind they plot together; they form an alliance against you—</p>
            <p><sup>6</sup> the tents of Edom and the Ishmaelites, of Moab and the Hagrites,</p>
            <p><sup>7</sup> Byblos, Ammon and Amalek, Philistia, with the people of Tyre.</p>
            <p><sup>8</sup> Even Assyria has joined them to reinforce Lot’s descendants.</p>
            <p><sup>9</sup> Do to them as you did to Midian, as you did to Sisera and Jabin at the river Kishon,</p>
            <p><sup>10</sup> who perished at Endor and became like dung on the ground.</p>
            <p><sup>11</sup> Make their nobles like Oreb and Zeeb, all their princes like Zebah and Zalmunna,</p>
            <p><sup>12</sup> who said, “Let us take possession of the pasturelands of God.”</p>
            <p><sup>13</sup> Make them like tumbleweed, my God, like chaff before the wind.</p>
            <p><sup>14</sup> As fire consumes the forest or a flame sets the mountains ablaze,</p>
            <p><sup>15</sup> so pursue them with your tempest and terrify them with your storm.</p>
            <p><sup>16</sup> Cover their faces with shame, Lord, so that they will seek your name.</p>
            <p><sup>17</sup> May they ever be ashamed and dismayed; may they perish in disgrace.</p>
            <p><sup>18</sup> Let them know that you, whose name is the Lord— that you alone are the Most High over all the earth.</p>
