            <h4>For the director of music. According to gittith. Of the Sons of Korah. A psalm.</h4>
            <p><sup>1</sup> How lovely is your dwelling place, Lord Almighty!</p>
            <p><sup>2</sup> My soul yearns, even faints, for the courts of the Lord; my heart and my flesh cry out for the living God.</p>
            <p><sup>3</sup> Even the sparrow has found a home, and the swallow a nest for herself, where she may have her youngâ€” a place near your altar, Lord Almighty, my King and my God.</p>
            <p><sup>4</sup> Blessed are those who dwell in your house; they are ever praising you.</p>
            <p><sup>5</sup> Blessed are those whose strength is in you, whose hearts are set on pilgrimage.</p>
            <p><sup>6</sup> As they pass through the Valley of Baka, they make it a place of springs; the autumn rains also cover it with pools.</p>
            <p><sup>7</sup> They go from strength to strength, till each appears before God in Zion.</p>
            <p><sup>8</sup> Hear my prayer, Lord God Almighty; listen to me, God of Jacob.</p>
            <p><sup>9</sup> Look on our shield, O God; look with favor on your anointed one.</p>
            <p><sup>10</sup> Better is one day in your courts than a thousand elsewhere; I would rather be a doorkeeper in the house of my God than dwell in the tents of the wicked.</p>
            <p><sup>11</sup> For the Lord God is a sun and shield; the Lord bestows favor and honor; no good thing does he withhold from those whose walk is blameless.</p>
            <p><sup>12</sup> Lord Almighty, blessed is the one who trusts in you.</p>
