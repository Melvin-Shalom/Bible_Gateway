            <h4>Of David.</h4>
            <p><sup>1</sup> Praise be to the Lord my Rock, who trains my hands for war, my fingers for battle.</p>
            <p><sup>2</sup> He is my loving God and my fortress, my stronghold and my deliverer, my shield, in whom I take refuge, who subdues peoples under me.</p>
            <p><sup>3</sup> Lord, what are human beings that you care for them, mere mortals that you think of them?</p>
            <p><sup>4</sup> They are like a breath; their days are like a fleeting shadow.</p>
            <p><sup>5</sup> Part your heavens, Lord, and come down; touch the mountains, so that they smoke.</p>
            <p><sup>6</sup> Send forth lightning and scatter the enemy; shoot your arrows and rout them.</p>
            <p><sup>7</sup> Reach down your hand from on high; deliver me and rescue me from the mighty waters, from the hands of foreigners</p>
            <p><sup>8</sup> whose mouths are full of lies, whose right hands are deceitful.</p>
            <p><sup>9</sup> I will sing a new song to you, my God; on the ten-stringed lyre I will make music to you.</p>
            <p><sup>10</sup> To the One who gives victory to kings, who delivers his servant David. From the deadly sword deliver me.</p>
            <p><sup>11</sup> Deliver me from the hands of foreigners whose mouths are full of lies, whose right hands are deceitful.</p>
            <p><sup>12</sup> Then our sons in their youth will be like well-nurtured plants, and our daughters will be like pillars carved to adorn a palace.</p>
            <p><sup>13</sup> Our barns will be filled with every kind of provision. Our sheep will increase by thousands, by tens of thousands in our fields;</p>
            <p><sup>14</sup> our oxen will draw heavy loads. There will be no breaching of walls, no going into captivity, no cry of distress in our streets.</p>
            <p><sup>15</sup> Blessed is the people of whom this is true; blessed is the people whose God is the Lord.</p>
