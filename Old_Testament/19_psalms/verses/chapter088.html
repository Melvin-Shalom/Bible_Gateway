            <p><sup>1</sup> Lord, you are the God who saves me; day and night I cry out to you.</p>
            <p><sup>2</sup> May my prayer come before you; turn your ear to my cry.</p>
            <p><sup>3</sup> I am overwhelmed with troubles and my life draws near to death.</p>
            <p><sup>4</sup> I am counted among those who go down to the pit; I am like one without strength.</p>
            <p><sup>5</sup> I am set apart with the dead, like the slain who lie in the grave, whom you remember no more, who are cut off from your care.</p>
            <p><sup>6</sup> You have put me in the lowest pit, in the darkest depths.</p>
            <p><sup>7</sup> Your wrath lies heavily on me; you have overwhelmed me with all your waves.</p>
            <p><sup>8</sup> You have taken from me my closest friends and have made me repulsive to them. I am confined and cannot escape;</p>
            <p><sup>9</sup> my eyes are dim with grief. I call to you, Lord, every day; I spread out my hands to you.</p>
            <p><sup>10</sup> Do you show your wonders to the dead? Do their spirits rise up and praise you?</p>
            <p><sup>11</sup> Is your love declared in the grave, your faithfulness in Destruction?</p>
            <p><sup>12</sup> Are your wonders known in the place of darkness, or your righteous deeds in the land of oblivion?</p>
            <p><sup>13</sup> But I cry to you for help, Lord; in the morning my prayer comes before you.</p>
            <p><sup>14</sup> Why, Lord, do you reject me and hide your face from me?</p>
            <p><sup>15</sup> From my youth I have suffered and been close to death; I have borne your terrors and am in despair.</p>
            <p><sup>16</sup> Your wrath has swept over me; your terrors have destroyed me.</p>
            <p><sup>17</sup> All day long they surround me like a flood; they have completely engulfed me.</p>
            <p><sup>18</sup> You have taken from me friend and neighborâ€” darkness is my closest friend.</p>
