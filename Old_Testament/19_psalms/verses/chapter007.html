            <h4>A shiggaion of David, which he sang to the Lord concerning Cush, a Benjamite.</h4>
            <p><sup>1</sup> Lord my God, I take refuge in you; save and deliver me from all who pursue me,</p>
            <p><sup>2</sup> or they will tear me apart like a lion and rip me to pieces with no one to rescue me.</p>
            <p><sup>3</sup> Lord my God, if I have done this and there is guilt on my hands—</p>
            <p><sup>4</sup> if I have repaid my ally with evil or without cause have robbed my foe—</p>
            <p><sup>5</sup> then let my enemy pursue and overtake me; let him trample my life to the ground and make me sleep in the dust.</p>
            <p><sup>6</sup> Arise, Lord, in your anger; rise up against the rage of my enemies. Awake, my God; decree justice.</p>
            <p><sup>7</sup> Let the assembled peoples gather around you, while you sit enthroned over them on high.</p>
            <p><sup>8</sup> Let the Lord judge the peoples. Vindicate me, Lord, according to my righteousness, according to my integrity, O Most High.</p>
            <p><sup>9</sup> Bring to an end the violence of the wicked and make the righteous secure— you, the righteous God who probes minds and hearts.</p>
            <p><sup>10</sup> My shield is God Most High, who saves the upright in heart.</p>
            <p><sup>11</sup> God is a righteous judge, a God who displays his wrath every day.</p>
            <p><sup>12</sup> If he does not relent, he will sharpen his sword; he will bend and string his bow.</p>
            <p><sup>13</sup> He has prepared his deadly weapons; he makes ready his flaming arrows.</p>
            <p><sup>14</sup> Whoever is pregnant with evil conceives trouble and gives birth to disillusionment.</p>
            <p><sup>15</sup> Whoever digs a hole and scoops it out falls into the pit they have made.</p>
            <p><sup>16</sup> The trouble they cause recoils on them; their violence comes down on their own heads.</p>
            <p><sup>17</sup> I will give thanks to the Lord because of his righteousness; I will sing the praises of the name of the Lord Most High.</p>
