            <h4>For the director of music. Of David.</h4>
            <p><sup>1</sup> The fool says in his heart, “There is no God.” They are corrupt, their deeds are vile; there is no one who does good.</p>
            <p><sup>2</sup> The Lord looks down from heaven on all mankind to see if there are any who understand, any who seek God.</p>
            <p><sup>3</sup> All have turned away, all have become corrupt; there is no one who does good, not even one.</p>
            <p><sup>4</sup> Do all these evildoers know nothing? They devour my people as though eating bread; they never call on the Lord.</p>
            <p><sup>5</sup> But there they are, overwhelmed with dread, for God is present in the company of the righteous.</p>
            <p><sup>6</sup> You evildoers frustrate the plans of the poor, but the Lord is their refuge.</p>
            <p><sup>7</sup> Oh, that salvation for Israel would come out of Zion! When the Lord restores his people, let Jacob rejoice and Israel be glad!</p>
