            <h4>For the director of music. With stringed instruments. A maskil of David. When the Ziphites had gone to Saul and said, <strong>“Is not David hiding among us?”</strong></h4>
            <p><sup>1</sup> Save me, O God, by your name; vindicate me by your might.</p>
            <p><sup>2</sup> Hear my prayer, O God; listen to the words of my mouth.</p>
            <p><sup>3</sup> Arrogant foes are attacking me; ruthless people are trying to kill me—people without regard for God.</p>
            <p><sup>4</sup> Surely God is my help; the Lord is the one who sustains me.</p>
            <p><sup>5</sup> Let evil recoil on those who slander me; in your faithfulness destroy them.</p>
            <p><sup>6</sup> I will sacrifice a freewill offering to you; I will praise your name, Lord, for it is good.</p>
            <p><sup>7</sup> You have delivered me from all my troubles, and my eyes have looked in triumph on my foes.</p>
