            <h4>For the director of music. For Jeduthun. Of Asaph. A psalm.</h4>
            <p><sup>1</sup> I cried out to God for help; I cried out to God to hear me.</p>
            <p><sup>2</sup> When I was in distress, I sought the Lord; at night I stretched out untiring hands, and I would not be comforted.</p>
            <p><sup>3</sup> I remembered you, God, and I groaned; I meditated, and my spirit grew faint.</p>
            <p><sup>4</sup> You kept my eyes from closing; I was too troubled to speak.</p>
            <p><sup>5</sup> I thought about the former days, the years of long ago;</p>
            <p><sup>6</sup> I remembered my songs in the night. My heart meditated and my spirit asked:</p>
            <p><sup>7</sup> “Will the Lord reject forever? Will he never show his favor again?</p>
            <p><sup>8</sup> Has his unfailing love vanished forever? Has his promise failed for all time?</p>
            <p><sup>9</sup> Has God forgotten to be merciful? Has he in anger withheld his compassion?”</p>
            <p><sup>10</sup> Then I thought, “To this I will appeal: the years when the Most High stretched out his right hand.</p>
            <p><sup>11</sup> I will remember the deeds of the Lord; yes, I will remember your miracles of long ago.</p>
            <p><sup>12</sup> I will consider all your works and meditate on all your mighty deeds.”</p>
            <p><sup>13</sup> Your ways, God, are holy. What god is as great as our God?</p>
            <p><sup>14</sup> You are the God who performs miracles; you display your power among the peoples.</p>
            <p><sup>15</sup> With your mighty arm you redeemed your people, the descendants of Jacob and Joseph.</p>
            <p><sup>16</sup> The waters saw you, God, the waters saw you and writhed; the very depths were convulsed.</p>
            <p><sup>17</sup> The clouds poured down water, the heavens resounded with thunder; your arrows flashed back and forth.</p>
            <p><sup>18</sup> Your thunder was heard in the whirlwind, your lightning lit up the world; the earth trembled and quaked.</p>
            <p><sup>19</sup> Your path led through the sea, your way through the mighty waters, though your footprints were not seen.</p>
            <p><sup>20</sup> You led your people like a flock by the hand of Moses and Aaron.</p>
