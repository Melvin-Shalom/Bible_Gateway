            <p><sup>1</sup> Lord, do not rebuke me in your anger or discipline me in your wrath.</p>
            <p><sup>2</sup> Have mercy on me, Lord, for I am faint; heal me, Lord, for my bones are in agony.</p>
            <p><sup>3</sup> My soul is in deep anguish. How long, Lord, how long?</p>
            <p><sup>4</sup> Turn, Lord, and deliver me; save me because of your unfailing love.</p>
            <p><sup>5</sup> Among the dead no one proclaims your name. Who praises you from the grave?</p>
            <p><sup>6</sup> I am worn out from my groaning. All night long I flood my bed with weeping and drench my couch with tears.</p>
            <p><sup>7</sup> My eyes grow weak with sorrow; they fail because of all my foes.</p>
            <p><sup>8</sup> Away from me, all you who do evil, for the Lord has heard my weeping.</p>
            <p><sup>9</sup> The Lord has heard my cry for mercy; the Lord accepts my prayer.</p>
            <p><sup>10</sup> All my enemies will be overwhelmed with shame and anguish; they will turn back and suddenly be put to shame.</p>
