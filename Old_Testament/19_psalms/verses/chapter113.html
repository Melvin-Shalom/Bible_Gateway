            <p><sup>1</sup> Praise the Lord. Praise the Lord, you his servants; praise the name of the Lord.</p>
            <p><sup>2</sup> Let the name of the Lord be praised, both now and forevermore.</p>
            <p><sup>3</sup> From the rising of the sun to the place where it sets, the name of the Lord is to be praised.</p>
            <p><sup>4</sup> The Lord is exalted over all the nations, his glory above the heavens.</p>
            <p><sup>5</sup> Who is like the Lord our God, the One who sits enthroned on high,</p>
            <p><sup>6</sup> who stoops down to look on the heavens and the earth?</p>
            <p><sup>7</sup> He raises the poor from the dust and lifts the needy from the ash heap;</p>
            <p><sup>8</sup> he seats them with princes, with the princes of his people.</p>
            <p><sup>9</sup> He settles the childless woman in her home as a happy mother of children.</p>
            <p>Praise the Lord.</p>
