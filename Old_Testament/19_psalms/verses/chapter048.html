            <h4>A song. A psalm of the Sons of Korah.</h4>
            <p><sup>1</sup> Great is the Lord, and most worthy of praise, in the city of our God, his holy mountain.</p>
            <p><sup>2</sup> Beautiful in its loftiness, the joy of the whole earth, like the heights of Zaphon is Mount Zion, the city of the Great King.</p>
            <p><sup>3</sup> God is in her citadels; he has shown himself to be her fortress.</p>
            <p><sup>4</sup> When the kings joined forces, when they advanced together,</p>
            <p><sup>5</sup> they saw her and were astounded; they fled in terror.</p>
            <p><sup>6</sup> Trembling seized them there, pain like that of a woman in labor.</p>
            <p><sup>7</sup> You destroyed them like ships of Tarshish shattered by an east wind.</p>
            <p><sup>8</sup> As we have heard, so we have seen in the city of the Lord Almighty, in the city of our God: God makes her secure forever.</p>
            <p><sup>9</sup> Within your temple, O God, we meditate on your unfailing love.</p>
            <p><sup>10</sup> Like your name, O God, your praise reaches to the ends of the earth; your right hand is filled with righteousness.</p>
            <p><sup>11</sup> Mount Zion rejoices, the villages of Judah are glad because of your judgments.</p>
            <p><sup>12</sup> Walk about Zion, go around her, count her towers,</p>
            <p><sup>13</sup> consider well her ramparts, view her citadels, that you may tell of them to the next generation.</p>
            <p><sup>14</sup> For this God is our God for ever and ever; he will be our guide even to the end.</p>
