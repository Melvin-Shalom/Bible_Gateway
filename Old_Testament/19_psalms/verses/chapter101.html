            <h4>Of David. A psalm.</h4>
            <p><sup>1</sup> I will sing of your love and justice; to you, Lord, I will sing praise.</p>
            <p><sup>2</sup> I will be careful to lead a blameless lifeâ€” when will you come to me? I will conduct the affairs of my house with a blameless heart.</p>
            <p><sup>3</sup> I will not look with approval on anything that is vile. I hate what faithless people do; I will have no part in it.</p>
            <p><sup>4</sup> The perverse of heart shall be far from me; I will have nothing to do with what is evil.</p>
            <p><sup>5</sup> Whoever slanders their neighbor in secret, I will put to silence; whoever has haughty eyes and a proud heart, I will not tolerate.</p>
            <p><sup>6</sup> My eyes will be on the faithful in the land, that they may dwell with me; the one whose walk is blameless will minister to me.</p>
            <p><sup>7</sup> No one who practices deceit will dwell in my house; no one who speaks falsely will stand in my presence.</p>
            <p><sup>8</sup> Every morning I will put to silence all the wicked in the land; I will cut off every evildoer from the city of the Lord.</p>
