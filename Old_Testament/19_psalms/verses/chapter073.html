            <h4>A psalm of Asaph.</h4>
            <p><sup>1</sup> Surely God is good to Israel, to those who are pure in heart.</p>
            <p><sup>2</sup> But as for me, my feet had almost slipped; I had nearly lost my foothold.</p>
            <p><sup>3</sup> For I envied the arrogant when I saw the prosperity of the wicked.</p>
            <p><sup>4</sup> They have no struggles; their bodies are healthy and strong.</p>
            <p><sup>5</sup> They are free from common human burdens; they are not plagued by human ills.</p>
            <p><sup>6</sup> Therefore pride is their necklace; they clothe themselves with violence.</p>
            <p><sup>7</sup> From their callous hearts comes iniquity; their evil imaginations have no limits.</p>
            <p><sup>8</sup> They scoff, and speak with malice; with arrogance they threaten oppression.</p>
            <p><sup>9</sup> Their mouths lay claim to heaven, and their tongues take possession of the earth.</p>
            <p><sup>10</sup> Therefore their people turn to them and drink up waters in abundance.</p>
            <p><sup>11</sup> They say, “How would God know? Does the Most High know anything?”</p>
            <p><sup>12</sup> This is what the wicked are like—always free of care, they go on amassing wealth.</p>
            <p><sup>13</sup> Surely in vain I have kept my heart pure and have washed my hands in innocence.</p>
            <p><sup>14</sup> All day long I have been afflicted, and every morning brings new punishments.</p>
            <p><sup>15</sup> If I had spoken out like that, I would have betrayed your children.</p>
            <p><sup>16</sup> When I tried to understand all this, it troubled me deeply</p>
            <p><sup>17</sup> till I entered the sanctuary of God; then I understood their final destiny.</p>
            <p><sup>18</sup> Surely you place them on slippery ground; you cast them down to ruin.</p>
            <p><sup>19</sup> How suddenly are they destroyed, completely swept away by terrors!</p>
            <p><sup>20</sup> They are like a dream when one awakes; when you arise, Lord, you will despise them as fantasies.</p>
            <p><sup>21</sup> When my heart was grieved and my spirit embittered,</p>
            <p><sup>22</sup> I was senseless and ignorant; I was a brute beast before you.</p>
            <p><sup>23</sup> Yet I am always with you; you hold me by my right hand.</p>
            <p><sup>24</sup> You guide me with your counsel, and afterward you will take me into glory.</p>
            <p><sup>25</sup> Whom have I in heaven but you? And earth has nothing I desire besides you.</p>
            <p><sup>26</sup> My flesh and my heart may fail, but God is the strength of my heart and my portion forever.</p>
            <p><sup>27</sup> Those who are far from you will perish; you destroy all who are unfaithful to you.</p>
            <p><sup>28</sup> But as for me, it is good to be near God. I have made the Sovereign Lord my refuge; I will tell of all your deeds.</p>
