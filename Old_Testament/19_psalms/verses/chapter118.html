        <h1>Psalm 118</h1>
    </header>
    <main>
        <div>
            <p><sup>1</sup> Give thanks to the Lord, for he is good; his love endures forever.</p>
            <p><sup>2</sup> Let Israel say: “His love endures forever.”</p>
            <p><sup>3</sup> Let the house of Aaron say: “His love endures forever.”</p>
            <p><sup>4</sup> Let those who fear the Lord say: “His love endures forever.”</p>
            <p><sup>5</sup> When hard pressed, I cried to the Lord; he brought me into a spacious place.</p>
            <p><sup>6</sup> The Lord is with me; I will not be afraid. What can mere mortals do to me?</p>
            <p><sup>7</sup> The Lord is with me; he is my helper. I look in triumph on my enemies.</p>
            <p><sup>8</sup> It is better to take refuge in the Lord than to trust in humans.</p>
            <p><sup>9</sup> It is better to take refuge in the Lord than to trust in princes.</p>
            <p><sup>10</sup> All the nations surrounded me, but in the name of the Lord I cut them down.</p>
            <p><sup>11</sup> They surrounded me on every side, but in the name of the Lord I cut them down.</p>
            <p><sup>12</sup> They swarmed around me like bees, but they were consumed as quickly as burning thorns; in the name of the Lord I cut them down.</p>
            <p><sup>13</sup> I was pushed back and about to fall, but the Lord helped me.</p>
            <p><sup>14</sup> The Lord is my strength and my defense; he has become my salvation.</p>
            <p><sup>15</sup> Shouts of joy and victory resound in the tents of the righteous: “The Lord’s right hand has done mighty things!</p>
            <p><sup>16</sup> The Lord’s right hand is lifted high; the Lord’s right hand has done mighty things!”</p>
            <p><sup>17</sup> I will not die but live, and will proclaim what the Lord has done.</p>
            <p><sup>18</sup> The Lord has chastened me severely, but he has not given me over to death.</p>
            <p><sup>19</sup> Open for me the gates of the righteous; I will enter and give thanks to the Lord.</p>
            <p><sup>20</sup> This is the gate of the Lord through which the righteous may enter.</p>
            <p><sup>21</sup> I will give you thanks, for you answered me; you have become my salvation.</p>
            <p><sup>22</sup> The stone the builders rejected has become the cornerstone;</p>
            <p><sup>23</sup> the Lord has done this, and it is marvelous in our eyes.</p>
            <p><sup>24</sup> The Lord has done it this very day; let us rejoice today and be glad.</p>
            <p><sup>25</sup> Lord, save us! Lord, grant us success!</p>
            <p><sup>26</sup> Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord. From the house of the Lord we bless you.</p>
            <p><sup>27</sup> The Lord is God, and he has made his light shine on us. With boughs in hand, join in the festal procession up to the horns of the altar.</p>
            <p><sup>28</sup> You are my God, and I will praise you; you are my God, and I will exalt you.</p>
            <p><sup>29</sup> Give thanks to the Lord, for he is good; his love endures forever.</p>
