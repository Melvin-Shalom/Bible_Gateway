        <h1>Psalm 33</h1>
    </header>
    <main>
        <div>
            <p><sup>1</sup> Sing joyfully to the Lord, you righteous; it is fitting for the upright to praise him.</p>
            <p><sup>2</sup> Praise the Lord with the harp; make music to him on the ten-stringed lyre.</p>
            <p><sup>3</sup> Sing to him a new song; play skillfully, and shout for joy.</p>
            <p><sup>4</sup> For the word of the Lord is right and true; he is faithful in all he does.</p>
            <p><sup>5</sup> The Lord loves righteousness and justice; the earth is full of his unfailing love.</p>
            <p><sup>6</sup> By the word of the Lord the heavens were made, their starry host by the breath of his mouth.</p>
            <p><sup>7</sup> He gathers the waters of the sea into jars; he puts the deep into storehouses.</p>
            <p><sup>8</sup> Let all the earth fear the Lord; let all the people of the world revere him.</p>
            <p><sup>9</sup> For he spoke, and it came to be; he commanded, and it stood firm.</p>
            <p><sup>10</sup> The Lord foils the plans of the nations; he thwarts the purposes of the peoples.</p>
            <p><sup>11</sup> But the plans of the Lord stand firm forever, the purposes of his heart through all generations.</p>
            <p><sup>12</sup> Blessed is the nation whose God is the Lord, the people he chose for his inheritance.</p>
            <p><sup>13</sup> From heaven the Lord looks down and sees all mankind;</p>
            <p><sup>14</sup> from his dwelling place he watches all who live on earthâ€”</p>
            <p><sup>15</sup> he who forms the hearts of all, who considers everything they do.</p>
            <p><sup>16</sup> No king is saved by the size of his army; no warrior escapes by his great strength.</p>
            <p><sup>17</sup> A horse is a vain hope for deliverance; despite all its great strength it cannot save.</p>
            <p><sup>18</sup> But the eyes of the Lord are on those who fear him, on those whose hope is in his unfailing love,</p>
            <p><sup>19</sup> to deliver them from death and keep them alive in famine.</p>
            <p><sup>20</sup> We wait in hope for the Lord; he is our help and our shield.</p>
            <p><sup>21</sup> In him our hearts rejoice, for we trust in his holy name.</p>
            <p><sup>22</sup> May your unfailing love be with us, Lord, even as we put our hope in you.</p>
