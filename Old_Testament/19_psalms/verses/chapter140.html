            <h4>For the director of music. A psalm of David.</h4>
            <p><sup>1</sup> Rescue me, Lord, from evildoers; protect me from the violent,</p>
            <p><sup>2</sup> who devise evil plans in their hearts and stir up war every day.</p>
            <p><sup>3</sup> They make their tongues as sharp as a serpent’s; the poison of vipers is on their lips.</p>
            <p><sup>4</sup> Keep me safe, Lord, from the hands of the wicked; protect me from the violent, who devise ways to trip my feet.</p>
            <p><sup>5</sup> The arrogant have hidden a snare for me; they have spread out the cords of their net and have set traps for me along my path.</p>
            <p><sup>6</sup> I say to the Lord, “You are my God.” Hear, Lord, my cry for mercy.</p>
            <p><sup>7</sup> Sovereign Lord, my strong deliverer, you shield my head in the day of battle.</p>
            <p><sup>8</sup> Do not grant the wicked their desires, Lord; do not let their plans succeed.</p>
            <p><sup>9</sup> Those who surround me proudly rear their heads; may the mischief of their lips engulf them.</p>
            <p><sup>10</sup> May burning coals fall on them; may they be thrown into the fire, into miry pits, never to rise.</p>
            <p><sup>11</sup> May slanderers not be established in the land; may disaster hunt down the violent.</p>
            <p><sup>12</sup> I know that the Lord secures justice for the poor and upholds the cause of the needy.</p>
            <p><sup>13</sup> Surely the righteous will praise your name, and the upright will live in your presence.</p>
