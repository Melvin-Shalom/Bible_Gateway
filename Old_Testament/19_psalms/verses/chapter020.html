            <h4>For the director of music. A psalm of David.</h4>
            <p><sup>1</sup> May the Lord answer you when you are in distress; may the name of the God of Jacob protect you.</p>
            <p><sup>2</sup> May he send you help from the sanctuary and grant you support from Zion.</p>
            <p><sup>3</sup> May he remember all your sacrifices and accept your burnt offerings.</p>
            <p><sup>4</sup> May he give you the desire of your heart and make all your plans succeed.</p>
            <p><sup>5</sup> May we shout for joy over your victory and lift up our banners in the name of our God. May the Lord grant all your requests.</p>
            <p><sup>6</sup> Now this I know: The Lord gives victory to his anointed. He answers him from his heavenly sanctuary with the victorious power of his right hand.</p>
            <p><sup>7</sup> Some trust in chariots and some in horses, but we trust in the name of the Lord our God.</p>
            <p><sup>8</sup> They are brought to their knees and fall, but we rise up and stand firm.</p>
            <p><sup>9</sup> Lord, give victory to the king! Answer us when we call!</p>
