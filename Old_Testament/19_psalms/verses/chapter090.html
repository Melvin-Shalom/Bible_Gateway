            <h4>A prayer of Moses the man of God.</h4>
            <p><sup>1</sup> Lord, you have been our dwelling place throughout all generations.</p>
            <p><sup>2</sup> Before the mountains were born or you brought forth the whole world, from everlasting to everlasting you are God.</p>
            <p><sup>3</sup> You turn people back to dust, saying, “Return to dust, you mortals.”</p>
            <p><sup>4</sup> A thousand years in your sight are like a day that has just gone by, or like a watch in the night.</p>
            <p><sup>5</sup> Yet you sweep people away in the sleep of death—they are like the new grass of the morning:</p>
            <p><sup>6</sup> In the morning it springs up new, but by evening it is dry and withered.</p>
            <p><sup>7</sup> We are consumed by your anger and terrified by your indignation.</p>
            <p><sup>8</sup> You have set our iniquities before you, our secret sins in the light of your presence.</p>
            <p><sup>9</sup> All our days pass away under your wrath; we finish our years with a moan.</p>
            <p><sup>10</sup> Our days may come to seventy years, or eighty, if our strength endures; yet the best of them are but trouble and sorrow, for they quickly pass, and we fly away.</p>
            <p><sup>11</sup> If only we knew the power of your anger! Your wrath is as great as the fear that is your due.</p>
            <p><sup>12</sup> Teach us to number our days, that we may gain a heart of wisdom.</p>
            <p><sup>13</sup> Relent, Lord! How long will it be? Have compassion on your servants.</p>
            <p><sup>14</sup> Satisfy us in the morning with your unfailing love, that we may sing for joy and be glad all our days.</p>
            <p><sup>15</sup> Make us glad for as many days as you have afflicted us, for as many years as we have seen trouble.</p>
            <p><sup>16</sup> May your deeds be shown to your servants, your splendor to their children.</p>
            <p><sup>17</sup> May the favor of the Lord our God rest on us; establish the work of our hands for us—yes, establish the work of our hands.</p>
