            <p><sup>1</sup> In you, Lord, I have taken refuge; let me never be put to shame.</p>
            <p><sup>2</sup> In your righteousness, rescue me and deliver me; turn your ear to me and save me.</p>
            <p><sup>3</sup> Be my rock of refuge, to which I can always go; give the command to save me, for you are my rock and my fortress.</p>
            <p><sup>4</sup> Deliver me, my God, from the hand of the wicked, from the grasp of those who are evil and cruel.</p>
            <p><sup>5</sup> For you have been my hope, Sovereign Lord, my confidence since my youth.</p>
            <p><sup>6</sup> From birth I have relied on you; you brought me forth from my mother’s womb. I will ever praise you.</p>
            <p><sup>7</sup> I have become a sign to many; you are my strong refuge.</p>
            <p><sup>8</sup> My mouth is filled with your praise, declaring your splendor all day long.</p>
            <p><sup>9</sup> Do not cast me away when I am old; do not forsake me when my strength is gone.</p>
            <p><sup>10</sup> For my enemies speak against me; those who wait to kill me conspire together.</p>
            <p><sup>11</sup> They say, “God has forsaken him; pursue him and seize him, for no one will rescue him.”</p>
            <p><sup>12</sup> Do not be far from me, my God; come quickly, God, to help me.</p>
            <p><sup>13</sup> May my accusers perish in shame; may those who want to harm me be covered with scorn and disgrace.</p>
            <p><sup>14</sup> As for me, I will always have hope; I will praise you more and more.</p>
            <p><sup>15</sup> My mouth will tell of your righteous deeds, of your saving acts all day long—though I know not how to relate them all.</p>
            <p><sup>16</sup> I will come and proclaim your mighty acts, Sovereign Lord; I will proclaim your righteous deeds, yours alone.</p>
            <p><sup>17</sup> Since my youth, God, you have taught me, and to this day I declare your marvelous deeds.</p>
            <p><sup>18</sup> Even when I am old and gray, do not forsake me, my God, till I declare your power to the next generation, your mighty acts to all who are to come.</p>
            <p><sup>19</sup> Your righteousness, God, reaches to the heavens, you who have done great things. Who is like you, God?</p>
            <p><sup>20</sup> Though you have made me see troubles, many and bitter, you will restore my life again; from the depths of the earth you will again bring me up.</p>
            <p><sup>21</sup> You will increase my honor and comfort me once more.</p>
            <p><sup>22</sup> I will praise you with the harp for your faithfulness, my God; I will sing praise to you with the lyre, Holy One of Israel.</p>
            <p><sup>23</sup> My lips will shout for joy when I sing praise to you—I whom you have delivered.</p>
            <p><sup>24</sup> My tongue will tell of your righteous acts all day long, for those who wanted to harm me have been put to shame and confusion.</p>
