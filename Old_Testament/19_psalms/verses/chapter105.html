        <h1>Psalm 105</h1>
    </header>
    <main>
        <div>
            <p><sup>1</sup> Give praise to the Lord, proclaim his name; make known among the nations what he has done.</p>
            <p><sup>2</sup> Sing to him, sing praise to him; tell of all his wonderful acts.</p>
            <p><sup>3</sup> Glory in his holy name; let the hearts of those who seek the Lord rejoice.</p>
            <p><sup>4</sup> Look to the Lord and his strength; seek his face always.</p>
            <p><sup>5</sup> Remember the wonders he has done, his miracles, and the judgments he pronounced,</p>
            <p><sup>6</sup> you his servants, the descendants of Abraham, his chosen ones, the children of Jacob.</p>
            <p><sup>7</sup> He is the Lord our God; his judgments are in all the earth.</p>
            <p><sup>8</sup> He remembers his covenant forever, the promise he made, for a thousand generations,</p>
            <p><sup>9</sup> the covenant he made with Abraham, the oath he swore to Isaac.</p>
            <p><sup>10</sup> He confirmed it to Jacob as a decree, to Israel as an everlasting covenant:</p>
            <p><sup>11</sup> “To you I will give the land of Canaan as the portion you will inherit.”</p>
            <p><sup>12</sup> When they were but few in number, few indeed, and strangers in it,</p>
            <p><sup>13</sup> they wandered from nation to nation, from one kingdom to another.</p>
            <p><sup>14</sup> He allowed no one to oppress them; for their sake he rebuked kings:</p>
            <p><sup>15</sup> “Do not touch my anointed ones; do my prophets no harm.”</p>
            <p><sup>16</sup> He called down famine on the land and destroyed all their supplies of food;</p>
            <p><sup>17</sup> and he sent a man before them— Joseph, sold as a slave.</p>
            <p><sup>18</sup> They bruised his feet with shackles, his neck was put in irons,</p>
            <p><sup>19</sup> till what he foretold came to pass, till the word of the Lord proved him true.</p>
            <p><sup>20</sup> The king sent and released him, the ruler of peoples set him free.</p>
            <p><sup>21</sup> He made him master of his household, ruler over all he possessed,</p>
            <p><sup>22</sup> to instruct his princes as he pleased and teach his elders wisdom.</p>
            <p><sup>23</sup> Then Israel entered Egypt; Jacob resided as a foreigner in the land of Ham.</p>
            <p><sup>24</sup> The Lord made his people very fruitful; he made them too numerous for their foes,</p>
            <p><sup>25</sup> whose hearts he turned to hate his people, to conspire against his servants.</p>
            <p><sup>26</sup> He sent Moses his servant, and Aaron, whom he had chosen.</p>
            <p><sup>27</sup> They performed his signs among them, his wonders in the land of Ham.</p>
            <p><sup>28</sup> He sent darkness and made the land dark— for had they not rebelled against his words?</p>
            <p><sup>29</sup> He turned their waters into blood, causing their fish to die.</p>
            <p><sup>30</sup> Their land teemed with frogs, which went up into the bedrooms of their rulers.</p>
            <p><sup>31</sup> He spoke, and there came swarms of flies, and gnats throughout their country.</p>
            <p><sup>32</sup> He turned their rain into hail, with lightning throughout their land;</p>
            <p><sup>33</sup> he struck down their vines and fig trees and shattered the trees of their country.</p>
            <p><sup>34</sup> He spoke, and the locusts came, grasshoppers without number;</p>
            <p><sup>35</sup> they ate up every green thing in their land, ate up the produce of their soil.</p>
            <p><sup>36</sup> Then he struck down all the firstborn in their land, the firstfruits of all their manhood.</p>
            <p><sup>37</sup> He brought out Israel, laden with silver and gold, and from among their tribes no one faltered.</p>
            <p><sup>38</sup> Egypt was glad when they left, because dread of Israel had fallen on them.</p>
            <p><sup>39</sup> He spread out a cloud as a covering, and a fire to give light at night.</p>
            <p><sup>40</sup> They asked, and he brought them quail; he fed them well with the bread of heaven.</p>
            <p><sup>41</sup> He opened the rock, and water gushed out; it flowed like a river in the desert.</p>
            <p><sup>42</sup> For he remembered his holy promise given to his servant Abraham.</p>
            <p><sup>43</sup> He brought out his people with rejoicing, his chosen ones with shouts of joy;</p>
            <p><sup>44</sup> he gave them the lands of the nations, and they fell heir to what others had toiled for—</p>
            <p><sup>45</sup> that they might keep his precepts and observe his laws. Praise the Lord.</p>
