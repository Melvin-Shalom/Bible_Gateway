            <h4>A song of ascents. Of David.</h4>
            <p><sup>1</sup> I rejoiced with those who said to me, “Let us go to the house of the Lord.”</p>
            <p><sup>2</sup> Our feet are standing in your gates, Jerusalem.</p>
            <p><sup>3</sup> Jerusalem is built like a city that is closely compacted together.</p>
            <p><sup>4</sup> That is where the tribes go up— the tribes of the Lord— to praise the name of the Lord according to the statute given to Israel.</p>
            <p><sup>5</sup> There stand the thrones for judgment, the thrones of the house of David.</p>
            <p><sup>6</sup> Pray for the peace of Jerusalem: “May those who love you be secure.</p>
            <p><sup>7</sup> May there be peace within your walls and security within your citadels.”</p>
            <p><sup>8</sup> For the sake of my family and friends, I will say, “Peace be within you.”</p>
            <p><sup>9</sup> For the sake of the house of the Lord our God, I will seek your prosperity.</p>
