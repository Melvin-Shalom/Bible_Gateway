            <h4>For the director of music. To the tune of “The Lily of the Covenant.” A miktam of David. For teaching. When he fought Aram Naharaim and Aram Zobah, and when Joab returned and struck down twelve thousand Edomites in the Valley of Salt.</h4>
            <p><sup>1</sup> You have rejected us, God, and burst upon us; you have been angry—now restore us!</p>
            <p><sup>2</sup> You have shaken the land and torn it open; mend its fractures, for it is quaking.</p>
            <p><sup>3</sup> You have shown your people desperate times; you have given us wine that makes us stagger.</p>
            <p><sup>4</sup> But for those who fear you, you have raised a banner to be unfurled against the bow.</p>
            <p><sup>5</sup> Save us and help us with your right hand, that those you love may be delivered.</p>
            <p><sup>6</sup> God has spoken from his sanctuary: “In triumph I will parcel out Shechem and measure off the Valley of Sukkoth.</p>
            <p><sup>7</sup> Gilead is mine, and Manasseh is mine; Ephraim is my helmet, Judah is my scepter.</p>
            <p><sup>8</sup> Moab is my washbasin, on Edom I toss my sandal; over Philistia I shout in triumph.”</p>
            <p><sup>9</sup> Who will bring me to the fortified city? Who will lead me to Edom?</p>
            <p><sup>10</sup> Is it not you, God, you who have now rejected us and no longer go out with our armies?</p>
            <p><sup>11</sup> Give us aid against the enemy, for human help is worthless.</p>
            <p><sup>12</sup> With God we will gain the victory, and he will trample down our enemies.</p>
