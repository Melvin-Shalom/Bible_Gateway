            <h4>A psalm of David. A hymn of praise.</h4>
            <p><sup>1</sup> I waited patiently for the Lord; he turned to me and heard my cry.</p>
            <p><sup>2</sup> He lifted me out of the slimy pit, out of the mud and mire; he set my feet on a rock and gave me a firm place to stand.</p>
            <p><sup>3</sup> He put a new song in my mouth, a hymn of praise to our God. Many will see and fear the Lord and put their trust in him.</p>
            <p><sup>4</sup> Blessed is the one who trusts in the Lord, who does not look to the proud, to those who turn aside to false gods.</p>
            <p><sup>5</sup> Many, Lord my God, are the wonders you have done, the things you planned for us. None can compare with you; were I to speak and tell of your deeds, they would be too many to declare.</p>
            <p><sup>6</sup> Sacrifice and offering you did not desire— but my ears you have opened— burnt offerings and sin offerings you did not require.</p>
            <p><sup>7</sup> Then I said, “Here I am, I have come— it is written about me in the scroll.</p>
            <p><sup>8</sup> I desire to do your will, my God; your law is within my heart.”</p>
            <p><sup>9</sup> I proclaim your saving acts in the great assembly; I do not seal my lips, Lord, as you know.</p>
            <p><sup>10</sup> I do not hide your righteousness in my heart; I speak of your faithfulness and your saving help. I do not conceal your love and your faithfulness from the great assembly.</p>
            <p><sup>11</sup> Do not withhold your mercy from me, Lord; may your love and faithfulness always protect me.</p>
            <p><sup>12</sup> For troubles without number surround me; my sins have overtaken me, and I cannot see. They are more than the hairs of my head, and my heart fails within me.</p>
            <p><sup>13</sup> Be pleased to save me, Lord; come quickly, Lord, to help me.</p>
            <p><sup>14</sup> May all who want to take my life be put to shame and confusion; may all who desire my ruin be turned back in disgrace.</p>
            <p><sup>15</sup> May those who say to me, “Aha! Aha!” be appalled at their own shame.</p>
            <p><sup>16</sup> But may all who seek you rejoice and be glad in you; may those who long for your saving help always say, “The Lord is great!”</p>
            <p><sup>17</sup> But as for me, I am poor and needy; may the Lord think of me. You are my help and my deliverer; you are my God, do not delay.</p>
