            <h4>For the director of music. According to mahalath. A maskil of David.</h4>
            <p><sup>1</sup> The fool says in his heart, “There is no God.” They are corrupt, and their ways are vile; there is no one who does good.</p>
            <p><sup>2</sup> God looks down from heaven on all mankind to see if there are any who understand, any who seek God.</p>
            <p><sup>3</sup> Everyone has turned away, all have become corrupt; there is no one who does good, not even one.</p>
            <p><sup>4</sup> Do all these evildoers know nothing? They devour my people as though eating bread; they never call on God.</p>
            <p><sup>5</sup> But there they are, overwhelmed with dread, where there was nothing to dread. God scattered the bones of those who attacked you; you put them to shame, for God despised them.</p>
            <p><sup>6</sup> Oh, that salvation for Israel would come out of Zion! When God restores his people, let Jacob rejoice and Israel be glad!</p>
