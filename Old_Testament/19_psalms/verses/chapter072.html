            <h4>Of Solomon.</h4>
            <p><sup>1</sup> Endow the king with your justice, O God, the royal son with your righteousness.</p>
            <p><sup>2</sup> May he judge your people in righteousness, your afflicted ones with justice.</p>
            <p><sup>3</sup> The mountains may bring prosperity to the people, the hills the fruit of righteousness.</p>
            <p><sup>4</sup> May he defend the afflicted among the people and save the children of the needy; may he crush the oppressor.</p>
            <p><sup>5</sup> May he endure as long as the sun, as long as the moon, through all generations.</p>
            <p><sup>6</sup> May he be like rain falling on a mown field, like showers watering the earth.</p>
            <p><sup>7</sup> In his days may the righteous flourish and prosperity abound till the moon is no more.</p>
            <p><sup>8</sup> May he rule from sea to sea and from the River to the ends of the earth.</p>
            <p><sup>9</sup> The desert tribes will bow before him and his enemies will lick the dust.</p>
            <p><sup>10</sup> The kings of Tarshish and of distant shores will bring tribute to him; the kings of Sheba and Seba will present him gifts.</p>
            <p><sup>11</sup> May all kings bow down to him and all nations serve him.</p>
            <p><sup>12</sup> For he will deliver the needy who cry out, the afflicted who have no one to help.</p>
            <p><sup>13</sup> He will take pity on the weak and the needy and save the needy from death.</p>
            <p><sup>14</sup> He will rescue them from oppression and violence, for precious is their blood in his sight.</p>
            <p><sup>15</sup> Long may he live! May gold from Sheba be given him. May people ever pray for him and bless him all day long.</p>
            <p><sup>16</sup> May grain abound throughout the land; on the tops of the hills may it sway. May the crops flourish like Lebanon and thrive like the grass of the field.</p>
            <p><sup>17</sup> May his name endure forever; may it continue as long as the sun. All nations will be blessed through him, and they will call him blessed.</p>
            <p><sup>18</sup> Praise be to the Lord God, the God of Israel, who alone does marvelous deeds.</p>
            <p><sup>19</sup> Praise be to his glorious name forever; may the whole earth be filled with his glory. Amen and Amen.</p>
            <p><sup>20</sup> This concludes the prayers of David son of Jesse.</p>
