            <p><sup>1</sup> Give thanks to the Lord, for he is good; his love endures forever.</p>
            <p><sup>2</sup> Let the redeemed of the Lord tell their story— those he redeemed from the hand of the foe,</p>
            <p><sup>3</sup> those he gathered from the lands, from east and west, from north and south.</p>
            <p><sup>4</sup> Some wandered in desert wastelands, finding no way to a city where they could settle.</p>
            <p><sup>5</sup> They were hungry and thirsty, and their lives ebbed away.</p>
            <p><sup>6</sup> Then they cried out to the Lord in their trouble, and he delivered them from their distress.</p>
            <p><sup>7</sup> He led them by a straight way to a city where they could settle.</p>
            <p><sup>8</sup> Let them give thanks to the Lord for his unfailing love and his wonderful deeds for mankind,</p>
            <p><sup>9</sup> for he satisfies the thirsty and fills the hungry with good things.</p>
            <p><sup>10</sup> Some sat in darkness, in utter darkness, prisoners suffering in iron chains,</p>
            <p><sup>11</sup> because they rebelled against God's commands and despised the plans of the Most High.</p>
            <p><sup>12</sup> So he subjected them to bitter labor; they stumbled, and there was no one to help.</p>
            <p><sup>13</sup> Then they cried to the Lord in their trouble, and he saved them from their distress.</p>
            <p><sup>14</sup> He brought them out of darkness, the utter darkness, and broke away their chains.</p>
            <p><sup>15</sup> Let them give thanks to the Lord for his unfailing love and his wonderful deeds for mankind,</p>
            <p><sup>16</sup> for he breaks down gates of bronze and cuts through bars of iron.</p>
            <p><sup>17</sup> Some became fools through their rebellious ways and suffered affliction because of their iniquities.</p>
            <p><sup>18</sup> They loathed all food and drew near the gates of death.</p>
            <p><sup>19</sup> Then they cried to the Lord in their trouble, and he saved them from their distress.</p>
            <p><sup>20</sup> He sent out his word and healed them; he rescued them from the grave.</p>
            <p><sup>21</sup> Let them give thanks to the Lord for his unfailing love and his wonderful deeds for mankind.</p>
            <p><sup>22</sup> Let them sacrifice thank offerings and tell of his works with songs of joy.</p>
            <p><sup>23</sup> Some went out on the sea in ships; they were merchants on the mighty waters.</p>
            <p><sup>24</sup> They saw the works of the Lord, his wonderful deeds in the deep.</p>
            <p><sup>25</sup> For he spoke and stirred up a tempest that lifted high the waves.</p>
            <p><sup>26</sup> They mounted up to the heavens and went down to the depths; in their peril their courage melted away.</p>
            <p><sup>27</sup> They reeled and staggered like drunkards; they were at their wits’ end.</p>
            <p><sup>28</sup> Then they cried out to the Lord in their trouble, and he brought them out of their distress.</p>
            <p><sup>29</sup> He stilled the storm to a whisper; the waves of the sea were hushed.</p>
            <p><sup>30</sup> They were glad when it grew calm, and he guided them to their desired haven.</p>
            <p><sup>31</sup> Let them give thanks to the Lord for his unfailing love and his wonderful deeds for mankind.</p>
            <p><sup>32</sup> Let them exalt him in the assembly of the people and praise him in the council of the elders.</p>
            <p><sup>33</sup> He turned rivers into a desert, flowing springs into thirsty ground,</p>
            <p><sup>34</sup> and fruitful land into a salt waste, because of the wickedness of those who lived there.</p>
            <p><sup>35</sup> He turned the desert into pools of water and the parched ground into flowing springs;</p>
            <p><sup>36</sup> there he brought the hungry to live, and they founded a city where they could settle.</p>
            <p><sup>37</sup> They sowed fields and planted vineyards that yielded a fruitful harvest;</p>
            <p><sup>38</sup> he blessed them, and their numbers greatly increased, and he did not let their herds diminish.</p>
            <p><sup>39</sup> Then their numbers decreased, and they were humbled by oppression, calamity and sorrow;</p>
            <p><sup>40</sup> he who pours contempt on nobles made them wander in a trackless waste.</p>
            <p><sup>41</sup> But he lifted the needy out of their affliction and increased their families like flocks.</p>
            <p><sup>42</sup> The upright see and rejoice, but all the wicked shut their mouths.</p>
            <p><sup>43</sup> Let the one who is wise heed these things and ponder the loving deeds of the Lord.</p>
