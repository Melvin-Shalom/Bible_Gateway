    </header>
    <main>
        <div>
            <p><sup>1</sup> Whoever dwells in the shelter of the Most High will rest in the shadow of the Almighty.</p>
            <p><sup>2</sup> I will say of the Lord, “He is my refuge and my fortress, my God, in whom I trust.”</p>
            <p><sup>3</sup> Surely he will save you from the fowler’s snare and from the deadly pestilence.</p>
            <p><sup>4</sup> He will cover you with his feathers, and under his wings you will find refuge; his faithfulness will be your shield and rampart.</p>
            <p><sup>5</sup> You will not fear the terror of night, nor the arrow that flies by day,</p>
            <p><sup>6</sup> nor the pestilence that stalks in the darkness, nor the plague that destroys at midday.</p>
            <p><sup>7</sup> A thousand may fall at your side, ten thousand at your right hand, but it will not come near you.</p>
            <p><sup>8</sup> You will only observe with your eyes and see the punishment of the wicked.</p>
            <p><sup>9</sup> If you say, “The Lord is my refuge,” and you make the Most High your dwelling,</p>
            <p><sup>10</sup> no harm will overtake you, no disaster will come near your tent.</p>
            <p><sup>11</sup> For he will command his angels concerning you to guard you in all your ways;</p>
            <p><sup>12</sup> they will lift you up in their hands, so that you will not strike your foot against a stone.</p>
            <p><sup>13</sup> You will tread on the lion and the cobra; you will trample the great lion and the serpent.</p>
            <p><sup>14</sup> “Because he loves me,” says the Lord, “I will rescue him; I will protect him, for he acknowledges my name.</p>
            <p><sup>15</sup> He will call on me, and I will answer him; I will be with him in trouble, I will deliver him and honor him.</p>
            <p><sup>16</sup> With long life I will satisfy him and show him my salvation.”</p>
