            <h4>A prayer of David.</h4>
            <p><sup>1</sup> Hear me, Lord, and answer me, for I am poor and needy.</p>
            <p><sup>2</sup> Guard my life, for I am faithful to you; save your servant who trusts in you. You are my God;</p>
            <p><sup>3</sup> have mercy on me, Lord, for I call to you all day long.</p>
            <p><sup>4</sup> Bring joy to your servant, Lord, for I put my trust in you.</p>
            <p><sup>5</sup> You, Lord, are forgiving and good, abounding in love to all who call to you.</p>
            <p><sup>6</sup> Hear my prayer, Lord; listen to my cry for mercy.</p>
            <p><sup>7</sup> When I am in distress, I call to you, because you answer me.</p>
            <p><sup>8</sup> Among the gods there is none like you, Lord; no deeds can compare with yours.</p>
            <p><sup>9</sup> All the nations you have made will come and worship before you, Lord; they will bring glory to your name.</p>
            <p><sup>10</sup> For you are great and do marvelous deeds; you alone are God.</p>
            <p><sup>11</sup> Teach me your way, Lord, that I may rely on your faithfulness; give me an undivided heart, that I may fear your name.</p>
            <p><sup>12</sup> I will praise you, Lord my God, with all my heart; I will glorify your name forever.</p>
            <p><sup>13</sup> For great is your love toward me; you have delivered me from the depths, from the realm of the dead.</p>
            <p><sup>14</sup> Arrogant foes are attacking me, O God; ruthless people are trying to kill meâ€” they have no regard for you.</p>
            <p><sup>15</sup> But you, Lord, are a compassionate and gracious God, slow to anger, abounding in love and faithfulness.</p>
            <p><sup>16</sup> Turn to me and have mercy on me; show your strength in behalf of your servant; save me, because I serve you just as my mother did.</p>
            <p><sup>17</sup> Give me a sign of your goodness, that my enemies may see it and be put to shame, for you, Lord, have helped me and comforted me.</p>
