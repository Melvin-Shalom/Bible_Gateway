        <div>
            <p><sup>1</sup> Not to us, Lord, not to us but to your name be the glory, because of your love and faithfulness.</p>
            <p><sup>2</sup> Why do the nations say, “Where is their God?”</p>
            <p><sup>3</sup> Our God is in heaven; he does whatever pleases him.</p>
            <p><sup>4</sup> But their idols are silver and gold, made by human hands.</p>
            <p><sup>5</sup> They have mouths, but cannot speak, eyes, but cannot see.</p>
            <p><sup>6</sup> They have ears, but cannot hear, noses, but cannot smell.</p>
            <p><sup>7</sup> They have hands, but cannot feel, feet, but cannot walk, nor can they utter a sound with their throats.</p>
            <p><sup>8</sup> Those who make them will be like them, and so will all who trust in them.</p>
            <p><sup>9</sup> All you Israelites, trust in the Lord— he is their help and shield.</p>
            <p><sup>10</sup> House of Aaron, trust in the Lord— he is their help and shield.</p>
            <p><sup>11</sup> You who fear him, trust in the Lord— he is their help and shield.</p>
            <p><sup>12</sup> The Lord remembers us and will bless us: He will bless his people Israel, he will bless the house of Aaron,</p>
            <p><sup>13</sup> he will bless those who fear the Lord— small and great alike.</p>
            <p><sup>14</sup> May the Lord cause you to flourish, both you and your children.</p>
            <p><sup>15</sup> May you be blessed by the Lord, the Maker of heaven and earth.</p>
            <p><sup>16</sup> The highest heavens belong to the Lord, but the earth he has given to mankind.</p>
            <p><sup>17</sup> It is not the dead who praise the Lord, those who go down to the place of silence;</p>
            <p><sup>18</sup> it is we who extol the Lord, both now and forevermore.</p>
            <p>Praise the Lord.</p>
