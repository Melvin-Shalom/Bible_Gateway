            <h4>For the director of music. A psalm of David.</h4>
            <p><sup>1</sup> The heavens declare the glory of God; the skies proclaim the work of his hands.</p>
            <p><sup>2</sup> Day after day they pour forth speech; night after night they reveal knowledge.</p>
            <p><sup>3</sup> They have no speech, they use no words; no sound is heard from them.</p>
            <p><sup>4</sup> Yet their voice goes out into all the earth, their words to the ends of the world. In the heavens God has pitched a tent for the sun.</p>
            <p><sup>5</sup> It is like a bridegroom coming out of his chamber, like a champion rejoicing to run his course.</p>
            <p><sup>6</sup> It rises at one end of the heavens and makes its circuit to the other; nothing is deprived of its warmth.</p>
            <p><sup>7</sup> The law of the Lord is perfect, refreshing the soul. The statutes of the Lord are trustworthy, making wise the simple.</p>
            <p><sup>8</sup> The precepts of the Lord are right, giving joy to the heart. The commands of the Lord are radiant, giving light to the eyes.</p>
            <p><sup>9</sup> The fear of the Lord is pure, enduring forever. The decrees of the Lord are firm, and all of them are righteous.</p>
            <p><sup>10</sup> They are more precious than gold, than much pure gold; they are sweeter than honey, than honey from the honeycomb.</p>
            <p><sup>11</sup> By them your servant is warned; in keeping them there is great reward.</p>
            <p><sup>12</sup> But who can discern their own errors? Forgive my hidden faults.</p>
            <p><sup>13</sup> Keep your servant also from willful sins; may they not rule over me. Then I will be blameless, innocent of great transgression.</p>
            <p><sup>14</sup> May these words of my mouth and this meditation of my heart be pleasing in your sight, Lord, my Rock and my Redeemer.</p>
