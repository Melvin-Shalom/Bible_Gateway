        <h1>Psalm 116</h1>
    </header>
    <main>
        <div>
            <p><sup>1</sup> I love the Lord, for he heard my voice; he heard my cry for mercy.</p>
            <p><sup>2</sup> Because he turned his ear to me, I will call on him as long as I live.</p>
            <p><sup>3</sup> The cords of death entangled me, the anguish of the grave came over me; I was overcome by distress and sorrow.</p>
            <p><sup>4</sup> Then I called on the name of the Lord: “Lord, save me!”</p>
            <p><sup>5</sup> The Lord is gracious and righteous; our God is full of compassion.</p>
            <p><sup>6</sup> The Lord protects the unwary; when I was brought low, he saved me.</p>
            <p><sup>7</sup> Return to your rest, my soul, for the Lord has been good to you.</p>
            <p><sup>8</sup> For you, Lord, have delivered me from death, my eyes from tears, my feet from stumbling,</p>
            <p><sup>9</sup> that I may walk before the Lord in the land of the living.</p>
            <p><sup>10</sup> I trusted in the Lord when I said, “I am greatly afflicted”;</p>
            <p><sup>11</sup> in my alarm I said, “Everyone is a liar.”</p>
            <p><sup>12</sup> What shall I return to the Lord for all his goodness to me?</p>
            <p><sup>13</sup> I will lift up the cup of salvation and call on the name of the Lord.</p>
            <p><sup>14</sup> I will fulfill my vows to the Lord in the presence of all his people.</p>
            <p><sup>15</sup> Precious in the sight of the Lord is the death of his faithful servants.</p>
            <p><sup>16</sup> Truly I am your servant, Lord; I serve you just as my mother did; you have freed me from my chains.</p>
            <p><sup>17</sup> I will sacrifice a thank offering to you and call on the name of the Lord.</p>
            <p><sup>18</sup> I will fulfill my vows to the Lord in the presence of all his people,</p>
            <p><sup>19</sup> in the courts of the house of the Lord— in your midst, Jerusalem.</p>
            <p>Praise the Lord.</p>
