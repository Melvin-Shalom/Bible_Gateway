            <h4>For the director of music. To the tune of “Do Not Destroy.” Of David. A miktam. When Saul had sent men to watch David’s house in order to kill him.</h4>
            <p><sup>1</sup> Deliver me from my enemies, O God; be my fortress against those who are attacking me.</p>
            <p><sup>2</sup> Deliver me from evildoers and save me from those who are after my blood.</p>
            <p><sup>3</sup> See how they lie in wait for me! Fierce men conspire against me for no offense or sin of mine, Lord.</p>
            <p><sup>4</sup> I have done no wrong, yet they are ready to attack me. Arise to help me; look on my plight!</p>
            <p><sup>5</sup> You, Lord God Almighty, you who are the God of Israel, rouse yourself to punish all the nations; show no mercy to wicked traitors.</p>
            <p><sup>6</sup> They return at evening, snarling like dogs, and prowl about the city.</p>
            <p><sup>7</sup> See what they spew from their mouths—the words from their lips are sharp as swords, and they think, “Who can hear us?”</p>
            <p><sup>8</sup> But you laugh at them, Lord; you scoff at all those nations.</p>
            <p><sup>9</sup> You are my strength, I watch for you; you, God, are my fortress,</p>
            <p><sup>10</sup> my God on whom I can rely.</p>
            <p>God will go before me and will let me gloat over those who slander me.</p>
            <p><sup>11</sup> But do not kill them, Lord our shield, or my people will forget. In your might uproot them and bring them down.</p>
            <p><sup>12</sup> For the sins of their mouths, for the words of their lips, let them be caught in their pride. For the curses and lies they utter,</p>
            <p><sup>13</sup> consume them in your wrath, consume them till they are no more. Then it will be known to the ends of the earth that God rules over Jacob.</p>
            <p><sup>14</sup> They return at evening, snarling like dogs, and prowl about the city.</p>
            <p><sup>15</sup> They wander about for food and howl if not satisfied.</p>
            <p><sup>16</sup> But I will sing of your strength, in the morning I will sing of your love; for you are my fortress, my refuge in times of trouble.</p>
            <p><sup>17</sup> You are my strength, I sing praise to you; you, God, are my fortress, my God on whom I can rely.</p>
