            <p><sup>1</sup> The Lord reigns, let the earth be glad; let the distant shores rejoice.</p>
            <p><sup>2</sup> Clouds and thick darkness surround him; righteousness and justice are the foundation of his throne.</p>
            <p><sup>3</sup> Fire goes before him and consumes his foes on every side.</p>
            <p><sup>4</sup> His lightning lights up the world; the earth sees and trembles.</p>
            <p><sup>5</sup> The mountains melt like wax before the Lord, before the Lord of all the earth.</p>
            <p><sup>6</sup> The heavens proclaim his righteousness, and all peoples see his glory.</p>
            <p><sup>7</sup> All who worship images are put to shame, those who boast in idolsâ€” worship him, all you gods!</p>
            <p><sup>8</sup> Zion hears and rejoices and the villages of Judah are glad because of your judgments, Lord.</p>
            <p><sup>9</sup> For you, Lord, are the Most High over all the earth; you are exalted far above all gods.</p>
            <p><sup>10</sup> Let those who love the Lord hate evil, for he guards the lives of his faithful ones and delivers them from the hand of the wicked.</p>
            <p><sup>11</sup> Light shines on the righteous and joy on the upright in heart.</p>
            <p><sup>12</sup> Rejoice in the Lord, you who are righteous, and praise his holy name.</p>
