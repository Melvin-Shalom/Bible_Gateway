            <h4>A maskil of Ethan the Ezrahite.</h4>
            <p><sup>1</sup> I will sing of the Lord’s great love forever; with my mouth I will make your faithfulness known through all generations.</p>
            <p><sup>2</sup> I will declare that your love stands firm forever, that you have established your faithfulness in heaven itself.</p>
            <p><sup>3</sup> You said, “I have made a covenant with my chosen one, I have sworn to David my servant,</p>
            <p><sup>4</sup> ‘I will establish your line forever and make your throne firm through all generations.’”</p>
            <p><sup>5</sup> The heavens praise your wonders, Lord, your faithfulness too, in the assembly of the holy ones.</p>
            <p><sup>6</sup> For who in the skies above can compare with the Lord? Who is like the Lord among the heavenly beings?</p>
            <p><sup>7</sup> In the council of the holy ones God is greatly feared; he is more awesome than all who surround him.</p>
            <p><sup>8</sup> Who is like you, Lord God Almighty? You, Lord, are mighty, and your faithfulness surrounds you.</p>
            <p><sup>9</sup> You rule over the surging sea; when its waves mount up, you still them.</p>
            <p><sup>10</sup> You crushed Rahab like one of the slain; with your strong arm you scattered your enemies.</p>
            <p><sup>11</sup> The heavens are yours, and yours also the earth; you founded the world and all that is in it.</p>
            <p><sup>12</sup> You created the north and the south; Tabor and Hermon sing for joy at your name.</p>
            <p><sup>13</sup> Your arm is endowed with power; your hand is strong, your right hand exalted.</p>
            <p><sup>14</sup> Righteousness and justice are the foundation of your throne; love and faithfulness go before you.</p>
            <p><sup>15</sup> Blessed are those who have learned to acclaim you, who walk in the light of your presence, Lord.</p>
            <p><sup>16</sup> They rejoice in your name all day long; they celebrate your righteousness.</p>
            <p><sup>17</sup> For you are their glory and strength, and by your favor you exalt our horn.</p>
            <p><sup>18</sup> Indeed, our shield belongs to the Lord, our king to the Holy One of Israel.</p>
            <p><sup>19</sup> Once you spoke in a vision, to your faithful people you said: “I have bestowed strength on a warrior; I have raised up a young man from among the people.</p>
            <p><sup>20</sup> I have found David my servant; with my sacred oil I have anointed him.</p>
            <p><sup>21</sup> My hand will sustain him; surely my arm will strengthen him.</p>
            <p><sup>22</sup> The enemy will not get the better of him; the wicked will not oppress him.</p>
            <p><sup>23</sup> I will crush his foes before him and strike down his adversaries.</p>
            <p><sup>24</sup> My faithful love will be with him, and through my name his horn will be exalted.</p>
            <p><sup>25</sup> I will set his hand over the sea, his right hand over the rivers.</p>
            <p><sup>26</sup> He will call out to me, ‘You are my Father, my God, the Rock my Savior.’</p>
            <p><sup>27</sup> And I will appoint him to be my firstborn, the most exalted of the kings of the earth.</p>
            <p><sup>28</sup> I will maintain my love to him forever, and my covenant with him will never fail.</p>
            <p><sup>29</sup> I will establish his line forever, his throne as long as the heavens endure.</p>
            <p><sup>30</sup> “If his sons forsake my law and do not follow my statutes,</p>
            <p><sup>31</sup> if they violate my decrees and fail to keep my commands,</p>
            <p><sup>32</sup> I will punish their sin with the rod, their iniquity with flogging;</p>
            <p><sup>33</sup> but I will not take my love from him, nor will I ever betray my faithfulness.</p>
            <p><sup>34</sup> I will not violate my covenant or alter what my lips have uttered.</p>
            <p><sup>35</sup> Once for all, I have sworn by my holiness— and I will not lie to David—</p>
            <p><sup>36</sup> that his line will continue forever and his throne endure before me like the sun;</p>
            <p><sup>37</sup> it will be established forever like the moon, the faithful witness in the sky.”</p>
            <p><sup>38</sup> But you have rejected, you have spurned, you have been very angry with your anointed one.</p>
            <p><sup>39</sup> You have renounced the covenant with your servant and have defiled his crown in the dust.</p>
            <p><sup>40</sup> You have broken through all his walls and reduced his strongholds to ruins.</p>
            <p><sup>41</sup> All who pass by have plundered him; he has become the scorn of his neighbors.</p>
            <p><sup>42</sup> You have exalted the right hand of his foes; you have made all his enemies rejoice.</p>
            <p><sup>43</sup> Indeed, you have turned back the edge of his sword and have not supported him in battle.</p>
            <p><sup>44</sup> You have put an end to his splendor and cast his throne to the ground.</p>
            <p><sup>45</sup> You have cut short the days of his youth; you have covered him with a mantle of shame.</p>
            <p><sup>46</sup> How long, Lord? Will you hide yourself forever? How long will your wrath burn like fire?</p>
            <p><sup>47</sup> Remember how fleeting is my life. For what futility you have created all humanity!</p>
            <p><sup>48</sup> Who can live and not see death, or who can escape the power of the grave?</p>
            <p><sup>49</sup> Lord, where is your former great love, which in your faithfulness you swore to David?</p>
            <p><sup>50</sup> Remember, Lord, how your servant has been mocked, how I bear in my heart the taunts of all the nations,</p>
            <p><sup>51</sup> the taunts with which your enemies, Lord, have mocked, with which they have mocked every step of your anointed one.</p>
            <p><sup>52</sup> Praise be to the Lord forever!</p>
            <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amen and Amen</p>
