            <h4>A maskil of David. When he was in the cave. A prayer.</h4>
            <p><sup>1</sup> I cry aloud to the Lord; I lift up my voice to the Lord for mercy.</p>
            <p><sup>2</sup> I pour out before him my complaint; before him I tell my trouble.</p>
            <p><sup>3</sup> When my spirit grows faint within me, it is you who watch over my way. In the path where I walk, people have hidden a snare for me.</p>
            <p><sup>4</sup> Look and see, there is no one at my right hand; no one is concerned for me. I have no refuge; no one cares for my life.</p>
            <p><sup>5</sup> I cry to you, Lord; I say, “You are my refuge, my portion in the land of the living.”</p>
            <p><sup>6</sup> Listen to my cry, for I am in desperate need; rescue me from those who pursue me, for they are too strong for me.</p>
            <p><sup>7</sup> Set me free from my prison, that I may praise your name. Then the righteous will gather about me because of your goodness to me.</p>
