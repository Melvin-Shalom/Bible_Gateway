            <h4>A psalm. A song. For the dedication of the temple. Of David.</h4>
            <p><sup>1</sup> I will exalt you, Lord, for you lifted me out of the depths and did not let my enemies gloat over me.</p>
            <p><sup>2</sup> Lord my God, I called to you for help, and you healed me.</p>
            <p><sup>3</sup> You, Lord, brought me up from the realm of the dead; you spared me from going down to the pit.</p>
            <p><sup>4</sup> Sing the praises of the Lord, you his faithful people; praise his holy name.</p>
            <p><sup>5</sup> For his anger lasts only a moment, but his favor lasts a lifetime; weeping may stay for the night, but rejoicing comes in the morning.</p>
            <p><sup>6</sup> When I felt secure, I said, “I will never be shaken.”</p>
            <p><sup>7</sup> Lord, when you favored me, you made my royal mountain stand firm; but when you hid your face, I was dismayed.</p>
            <p><sup>8</sup> To you, Lord, I called; to the Lord I cried for mercy:</p>
            <p><sup>9</sup> “What is gained if I am silenced, if I go down to the pit? Will the dust praise you? Will it proclaim your faithfulness?</p>
            <p><sup>10</sup> Hear, Lord, and be merciful to me; Lord, be my help.”</p>
            <p><sup>11</sup> You turned my wailing into dancing; you removed my sackcloth and clothed me with joy,</p>
            <p><sup>12</sup> that my heart may sing your praises and not be silent. Lord my God, I will praise you forever.</p>
