            <h4>A psalm. For giving grateful praise.</h4>
            <p><sup>1</sup> Shout for joy to the Lord, all the earth.</p>
            <p><sup>2</sup> Worship the Lord with gladness; come before him with joyful songs.</p>
            <p><sup>3</sup> Know that the Lord is God. It is he who made us, and we are his; we are his people, the sheep of his pasture.</p>
            <p><sup>4</sup> Enter his gates with thanksgiving and his courts with praise; give thanks to him and praise his name.</p>
            <p><sup>5</sup> For the Lord is good and his love endures forever; his faithfulness continues through all generations.</p>
