    <main>
        <div>
            <p><sup>1</sup> Praise the Lord. Sing to the Lord a new song, his praise in the assembly of his faithful people.</p>
            <p><sup>2</sup> Let Israel rejoice in their Maker; let the people of Zion be glad in their King.</p>
            <p><sup>3</sup> Let them praise his name with dancing and make music to him with timbrel and harp.</p>
            <p><sup>4</sup> For the Lord takes delight in his people; he crowns the humble with victory.</p>
            <p><sup>5</sup> Let his faithful people rejoice in this honor and sing for joy on their beds.</p>
            <p><sup>6</sup> May the praise of God be in their mouths and a double-edged sword in their hands,</p>
            <p><sup>7</sup> to inflict vengeance on the nations and punishment on the peoples,</p>
            <p><sup>8</sup> to bind their kings with fetters, their nobles with shackles of iron,</p>
            <p><sup>9</sup> to carry out the sentence written against them. This is the glory of all his faithful people.</p>
            <p>Praise the Lord.</p>
