            <p><sup>1</sup> Vindicate me, my God, and plead my cause against an unfaithful nation. Rescue me from those who are deceitful and wicked.</p>
            <p><sup>2</sup> You are God my stronghold. Why have you rejected me? Why must I go about mourning, oppressed by the enemy?</p>
            <p><sup>3</sup> Send me your light and your faithful care, let them lead me; let them bring me to your holy mountain, to the place where you dwell.</p>
            <p><sup>4</sup> Then I will go to the altar of God, to God, my joy and my delight. I will praise you with the lyre, O God, my God.</p>
            <p><sup>5</sup> Why, my soul, are you downcast? Why so disturbed within me? Put your hope in God, for I will yet praise him, my Savior and my God.</p>
