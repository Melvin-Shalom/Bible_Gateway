            <h4>For the director of music. A psalm of David.</h4>
            <p><sup>1</sup> Hear me, my God, as I voice my complaint; protect my life from the threat of the enemy.</p>
            <p><sup>2</sup> Hide me from the conspiracy of the wicked, from the plots of evildoers.</p>
            <p><sup>3</sup> They sharpen their tongues like swords and aim cruel words like deadly arrows.</p>
            <p><sup>4</sup> They shoot from ambush at the innocent; they shoot suddenly, without fear.</p>
            <p><sup>5</sup> They encourage each other in evil plans, they talk about hiding their snares; they say, “Who will see it?”</p>
            <p><sup>6</sup> They plot injustice and say, “We have devised a perfect plan!” Surely the human mind and heart are cunning.</p>
            <p><sup>7</sup> But God will shoot them with his arrows; they will suddenly be struck down.</p>
            <p><sup>8</sup> He will turn their own tongues against them and bring them to ruin; all who see them will shake their heads in scorn.</p>
            <p><sup>9</sup> All people will fear; they will proclaim the works of God and ponder what he has done.</p>
            <p><sup>10</sup> The righteous will rejoice in the Lord and take refuge in him; all the upright in heart will glory in him!</p>
