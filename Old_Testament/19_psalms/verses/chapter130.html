            <h4>A song of ascents.</h4>
            <p><sup>1</sup> Out of the depths I cry to you, Lord;</p>
            <p><sup>2</sup> Lord, hear my voice. Let your ears be attentive to my cry for mercy.</p>
            <p><sup>3</sup> If you, Lord, kept a record of sins, Lord, who could stand?</p>
            <p><sup>4</sup> But with you there is forgiveness, so that we can, with reverence, serve you.</p>
            <p><sup>5</sup> I wait for the Lord, my whole being waits, and in his word I put my hope.</p>
            <p><sup>6</sup> I wait for the Lord more than watchmen wait for the morning, more than watchmen wait for the morning.</p>
            <p><sup>7</sup> Israel, put your hope in the Lord, for with the Lord is unfailing love and with him is full redemption.</p>
            <p><sup>8</sup> He himself will redeem Israel from all their sins.</p>
