            <p><sup>1</sup> Praise the Lord. How good it is to sing praises to our God, how pleasant and fitting to praise him!</p>
            <p><sup>2</sup> The Lord builds up Jerusalem; he gathers the exiles of Israel.</p>
            <p><sup>3</sup> He heals the brokenhearted and binds up their wounds.</p>
            <p><sup>4</sup> He determines the number of the stars and calls them each by name.</p>
            <p><sup>5</sup> Great is our Lord and mighty in power; his understanding has no limit.</p>
            <p><sup>6</sup> The Lord sustains the humble but casts the wicked to the ground.</p>
            <p><sup>7</sup> Sing to the Lord with grateful praise; make music to our God on the harp.</p>
            <p><sup>8</sup> He covers the sky with clouds; he supplies the earth with rain and makes grass grow on the hills.</p>
            <p><sup>9</sup> He provides food for the cattle and for the young ravens when they call.</p>
            <p><sup>10</sup> His pleasure is not in the strength of the horse, nor his delight in the legs of a warrior;</p>
            <p><sup>11</sup> the Lord delights in those who fear him, who put their hope in his unfailing love.</p>
            <p><sup>12</sup> Extol the Lord, Jerusalem; praise your God, Zion.</p>
            <p><sup>13</sup> He strengthens the bars of your gates and blesses your people within you.</p>
            <p><sup>14</sup> He grants peace to your borders and satisfies you with the finest of wheat.</p>
            <p><sup>15</sup> He sends his command to the earth; his word runs swiftly.</p>
            <p><sup>16</sup> He spreads the snow like wool and scatters the frost like ashes.</p>
            <p><sup>17</sup> He hurls down his hail like pebbles. Who can withstand his icy blast?</p>
            <p><sup>18</sup> He sends his word and melts them; he stirs up his breezes, and the waters flow.</p>
            <p><sup>19</sup> He has revealed his word to Jacob, his laws and decrees to Israel.</p>
            <p><sup>20</sup> He has done this for no other nation; they do not know his laws. Praise the Lord.</p>
