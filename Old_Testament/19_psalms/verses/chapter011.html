            <h4>For the director of music. Of David.</h4>
            <p><sup>1</sup> In the Lord I take refuge. How then can you say to me: “Flee like a bird to your mountain.</p>
            <p><sup>2</sup> For look, the wicked bend their bows; they set their arrows against the strings to shoot from the shadows at the upright in heart.</p>
            <p><sup>3</sup> When the foundations are being destroyed, what can the righteous do?”</p>
            <p><sup>4</sup> The Lord is in his holy temple; the Lord is on his heavenly throne. He observes everyone on earth; his eyes examine them.</p>
            <p><sup>5</sup> The Lord examines the righteous, but the wicked, those who love violence, he hates with a passion.</p>
            <p><sup>6</sup> On the wicked he will rain fiery coals and burning sulfur; a scorching wind will be their lot.</p>
            <p><sup>7</sup> For the Lord is righteous, he loves justice; the upright will see his face.</p>
