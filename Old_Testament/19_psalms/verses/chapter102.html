            <h4>A prayer of an afflicted person who has grown weak and pours out a lament before the Lord.</h4>
            <p><sup>1</sup> Hear my prayer, Lord; let my cry for help come to you.</p>
            <p><sup>2</sup> Do not hide your face from me when I am in distress. Turn your ear to me; when I call, answer me quickly.</p>
            <p><sup>3</sup> For my days vanish like smoke; my bones burn like glowing embers.</p>
            <p><sup>4</sup> My heart is blighted and withered like grass; I forget to eat my food.</p>
            <p><sup>5</sup> In my distress I groan aloud and am reduced to skin and bones.</p>
            <p><sup>6</sup> I am like a desert owl, like an owl among the ruins.</p>
            <p><sup>7</sup> I lie awake; I have become like a bird alone on a roof.</p>
            <p><sup>8</sup> All day long my enemies taunt me; those who rail against me use my name as a curse.</p>
            <p><sup>9</sup> For I eat ashes as my food and mingle my drink with tears</p>
            <p><sup>10</sup> because of your great wrath, for you have taken me up and thrown me aside.</p>
            <p><sup>11</sup> My days are like the evening shadow; I wither away like grass.</p>
            <p><sup>12</sup> But you, Lord, sit enthroned forever; your renown endures through all generations.</p>
            <p><sup>13</sup> You will arise and have compassion on Zion, for it is time to show favor to her; the appointed time has come.</p>
            <p><sup>14</sup> For her stones are dear to your servants; her very dust moves them to pity.</p>
            <p><sup>15</sup> The nations will fear the name of the Lord, all the kings of the earth will revere your glory.</p>
            <p><sup>16</sup> For the Lord will rebuild Zion and appear in his glory.</p>
            <p><sup>17</sup> He will respond to the prayer of the destitute; he will not despise their plea.</p>
            <p><sup>18</sup> Let this be written for a future generation, that a people not yet created may praise the Lord:</p>
            <p><sup>19</sup> “The Lord looked down from his sanctuary on high, from heaven he viewed the earth,</p>
            <p><sup>20</sup> to hear the groans of the prisoners and release those condemned to death.”</p>
            <p><sup>21</sup> So the name of the Lord will be declared in Zion and his praise in Jerusalem</p>
            <p><sup>22</sup> when the peoples and the kingdoms assemble to worship the Lord.</p>
            <p><sup>23</sup> In the course of my life he broke my strength; he cut short my days.</p>
            <p><sup>24</sup> So I said: “Do not take me away, my God, in the midst of my days; your years go on through all generations.</p>
            <p><sup>25</sup> In the beginning you laid the foundations of the earth, and the heavens are the work of your hands.</p>
            <p><sup>26</sup> They will perish, but you remain; they will all wear out like a garment. Like clothing you will change them and they will be discarded.</p>
            <p><sup>27</sup> But you remain the same, and your years will never end.</p>
            <p><sup>28</sup> The children of your servants will live in your presence; their descendants will be established before you.”</p>
