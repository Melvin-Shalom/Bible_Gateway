            <h4>For the director of music. For Jeduthun. A psalm of David.</h4>
            <p><sup>1</sup> Truly my soul finds rest in God; my salvation comes from him.</p>
            <p><sup>2</sup> Truly he is my rock and my salvation; he is my fortress, I will never be shaken.</p>
            <p><sup>3</sup> How long will you assault me? Would all of you throw me down—this leaning wall, this tottering fence?</p>
            <p><sup>4</sup> Surely they intend to topple me from my lofty place; they take delight in lies. With their mouths they bless, but in their hearts they curse.</p>
            <p><sup>5</sup> Yes, my soul, find rest in God; my hope comes from him.</p>
            <p><sup>6</sup> Truly he is my rock and my salvation; he is my fortress, I will not be shaken.</p>
            <p><sup>7</sup> My salvation and my honor depend on God; he is my mighty rock, my refuge.</p>
            <p><sup>8</sup> Trust in him at all times, you people; pour out your hearts to him, for God is our refuge.</p>
            <p><sup>9</sup> Surely the lowborn are but a breath, the highborn are but a lie; if weighed on a balance, they are nothing; together they are only a breath.</p>
            <p><sup>10</sup> Do not trust in extortion or put vain hope in stolen goods; though your riches increase, do not set your heart on them.</p>
            <p><sup>11</sup> One thing God has spoken, two things I have heard: “Power belongs to you, God,</p>
            <p><sup>12</sup> and with you, Lord, is unfailing love”; and, “You reward everyone according to what they have done.”</p>
