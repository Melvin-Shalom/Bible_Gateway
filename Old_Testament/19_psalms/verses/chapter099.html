            <h4>The Lord reigns, let the nations tremble.</h4>
            <p><sup>1</sup> The Lord reigns, let the nations tremble; he sits enthroned between the cherubim, let the earth shake.</p>
            <p><sup>2</sup> Great is the Lord in Zion; he is exalted over all the nations.</p>
            <p><sup>3</sup> Let them praise your great and awesome name— he is holy.</p>
            <p><sup>4</sup> The King is mighty, he loves justice— you have established equity; in Jacob you have done what is just and right.</p>
            <p><sup>5</sup> Exalt the Lord our God and worship at his footstool; he is holy.</p>
            <p><sup>6</sup> Moses and Aaron were among his priests, Samuel was among those who called on his name; they called on the Lord and he answered them.</p>
            <p><sup>7</sup> He spoke to them from the pillar of cloud; they kept his statutes and the decrees he gave them.</p>
            <p><sup>8</sup> Lord our God, you answered them; you were to Israel a forgiving God, though you punished their misdeeds.</p>
            <p><sup>9</sup> Exalt the Lord our God and worship at his holy mountain, for the Lord our God is holy.</p>
