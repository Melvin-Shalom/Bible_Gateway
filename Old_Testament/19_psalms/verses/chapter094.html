            <h4>A psalm. A song.</h4>
            <p><sup>1</sup> The Lord is a God who avenges. O God who avenges, shine forth.</p>
            <p><sup>2</sup> Rise up, Judge of the earth; pay back to the proud what they deserve.</p>
            <p><sup>3</sup> How long, Lord, will the wicked, how long will the wicked be jubilant?</p>
            <p><sup>4</sup> They pour out arrogant words; all the evildoers are full of boasting.</p>
            <p><sup>5</sup> They crush your people, Lord; they oppress your inheritance.</p>
            <p><sup>6</sup> They slay the widow and the foreigner; they murder the fatherless.</p>
            <p><sup>7</sup> They say, “The Lord does not see; the God of Jacob takes no notice.”</p>
            <p><sup>8</sup> Take notice, you senseless ones among the people; you fools, when will you become wise?</p>
            <p><sup>9</sup> Does he who fashioned the ear not hear? Does he who formed the eye not see?</p>
            <p><sup>10</sup> Does he who disciplines nations not punish? Does he who teaches mankind lack knowledge?</p>
            <p><sup>11</sup> The Lord knows all human plans; he knows that they are futile.</p>
            <p><sup>12</sup> Blessed is the one you discipline, Lord, the one you teach from your law;</p>
            <p><sup>13</sup> you grant them relief from days of trouble, till a pit is dug for the wicked.</p>
            <p><sup>14</sup> For the Lord will not reject his people; he will never forsake his inheritance.</p>
            <p><sup>15</sup> Judgment will again be founded on righteousness, and all the upright in heart will follow it.</p>
            <p><sup>16</sup> Who will rise up for me against the wicked? Who will take a stand for me against evildoers?</p>
            <p><sup>17</sup> Unless the Lord had given me help, I would soon have dwelt in the silence of death.</p>
            <p><sup>18</sup> When I said, “My foot is slipping,” your unfailing love, Lord, supported me.</p>
            <p><sup>19</sup> When anxiety was great within me, your consolation brought me joy.</p>
            <p><sup>20</sup> Can a corrupt throne be allied with you—a throne that brings on misery by its decrees?</p>
            <p><sup>21</sup> The wicked band together against the righteous and condemn the innocent to death.</p>
            <p><sup>22</sup> But the Lord has become my fortress, and my God the rock in whom I take refuge.</p>
            <p><sup>23</sup> He will repay them for their sins and destroy them for their wickedness; the Lord our God will destroy them.</p>
