            <h4>A psalm of David.</h4>
            <p><sup>1</sup> Lord, who may dwell in your sacred tent? Who may live on your holy mountain?</p>
            <p><sup>2</sup> The one whose walk is blameless, who does what is righteous, who speaks the truth from their heart;</p>
            <p><sup>3</sup> whose tongue utters no slander, who does no wrong to a neighbor, and casts no slur on others;</p>
            <p><sup>4</sup> who despises a vile person but honors those who fear the Lord; who keeps an oath even when it hurts, and does not change their mind;</p>
            <p><sup>5</sup> who lends money to the poor without interest; who does not accept a bribe against the innocent. Whoever does these things will never be shaken.</p>
