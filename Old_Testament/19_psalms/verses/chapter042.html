        <h4>For the director of music. A maskil of the Sons of Korah.</h4>
        <p><sup>1</sup> As the deer pants for streams of water, so my soul pants for you, my God.</p>
        <p><sup>2</sup> My soul thirsts for God, for the living God. When can I go and meet with God?</p>
        <p><sup>3</sup> My tears have been my food day and night, while people say to me all day long, “Where is your God?”</p>
        <p><sup>4</sup> These things I remember as I pour out my soul: how I used to go to the house of God under the protection of the Mighty One with shouts of joy and praise among the festive throng.</p>
        <p><sup>5</sup> Why, my soul, are you downcast? Why so disturbed within me? Put your hope in God, for I will yet praise him, my Savior and my God.</p>
        <p><sup>6</sup> My soul is downcast within me; therefore I will remember you from the land of the Jordan, the heights of Hermon—from Mount Mizar.</p>
        <p><sup>7</sup> Deep calls to deep in the roar of your waterfalls; all your waves and breakers have swept over me.</p>
        <p><sup>8</sup> By day the Lord directs his love, at night his song is with me—a prayer to the God of my life.</p>
        <p><sup>9</sup> I say to God my Rock, “Why have you forgotten me? Why must I go about mourning, oppressed by the enemy?”</p>
        <p><sup>10</sup> My bones suffer mortal agony as my foes taunt me, saying to me all day long, “Where is your God?”</p>
        <p><sup>11</sup> Why, my soul, are you downcast? Why so disturbed within me? Put your hope in God, for I will yet praise him, my Savior and my God.</p>
