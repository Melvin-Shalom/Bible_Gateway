            <h4>A psalm of David.</h4>
            <p><sup>1</sup> Lord, hear my prayer, listen to my cry for mercy; in your faithfulness and righteousness come to my relief.</p>
            <p><sup>2</sup> Do not bring your servant into judgment, for no one living is righteous before you.</p>
            <p><sup>3</sup> The enemy pursues me, he crushes me to the ground; he makes me dwell in the darkness like those long dead.</p>
            <p><sup>4</sup> So my spirit grows faint within me; my heart within me is dismayed.</p>
            <p><sup>5</sup> I remember the days of long ago; I meditate on all your works and consider what your hands have done.</p>
            <p><sup>6</sup> I spread out my hands to you; I thirst for you like a parched land.</p>
            <p><sup>7</sup> Answer me quickly, Lord; my spirit fails. Do not hide your face from me or I will be like those who go down to the pit.</p>
            <p><sup>8</sup> Let the morning bring me word of your unfailing love, for I have put my trust in you. Show me the way I should go, for to you I entrust my life.</p>
            <p><sup>9</sup> Rescue me from my enemies, Lord, for I hide myself in you.</p>
            <p><sup>10</sup> Teach me to do your will, for you are my God; may your good Spirit lead me on level ground.</p>
            <p><sup>11</sup> For your nameâ€™s sake, Lord, preserve my life; in your righteousness, bring me out of trouble.</p>
            <p><sup>12</sup> In your unfailing love, silence my enemies; destroy all my foes, for I am your servant.</p>
