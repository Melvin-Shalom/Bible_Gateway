            <h4>For the director of music. A psalm of David.</h4>
            <p><sup>1</sup> The king rejoices in your strength, Lord. How great is his joy in the victories you give!</p>
            <p><sup>2</sup> You have granted him his heart’s desire and have not withheld the request of his lips.</p>
            <p><sup>3</sup> You came to greet him with rich blessings and placed a crown of pure gold on his head.</p>
            <p><sup>4</sup> He asked you for life, and you gave it to him—length of days, for ever and ever.</p>
            <p><sup>5</sup> Through the victories you gave, his glory is great; you have bestowed on him splendor and majesty.</p>
            <p><sup>6</sup> Surely you have granted him unending blessings and made him glad with the joy of your presence.</p>
            <p><sup>7</sup> For the king trusts in the Lord; through the unfailing love of the Most High he will not be shaken.</p>
            <p><sup>8</sup> Your hand will lay hold on all your enemies; your right hand will seize your foes.</p>
            <p><sup>9</sup> When you appear for battle, you will burn them up as in a blazing furnace. The Lord will swallow them up in his wrath, and his fire will consume them.</p>
            <p><sup>10</sup> You will destroy their descendants from the earth, their posterity from mankind.</p>
            <p><sup>11</sup> Though they plot evil against you and devise wicked schemes, they cannot succeed.</p>
            <p><sup>12</sup> You will make them turn their backs when you aim at them with drawn bow.</p>
            <p><sup>13</sup> Be exalted in your strength, Lord; we will sing and praise your might.</p>
