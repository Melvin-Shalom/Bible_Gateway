            <h4>Of David.</h4>
            <p><sup>1</sup> Praise the Lord, my soul; all my inmost being, praise his holy name.</p>
            <p><sup>2</sup> Praise the Lord, my soul, and forget not all his benefits—</p>
            <p><sup>3</sup> who forgives all your sins and heals all your diseases,</p>
            <p><sup>4</sup> who redeems your life from the pit and crowns you with love and compassion,</p>
            <p><sup>5</sup> who satisfies your desires with good things so that your youth is renewed like the eagle's.</p>
            <p><sup>6</sup> The Lord works righteousness and justice for all the oppressed.</p>
            <p><sup>7</sup> He made known his ways to Moses, his deeds to the people of Israel:</p>
            <p><sup>8</sup> The Lord is compassionate and gracious, slow to anger, abounding in love.</p>
            <p><sup>9</sup> He will not always accuse, nor will he harbor his anger forever;</p>
            <p><sup>10</sup> he does not treat us as our sins deserve or repay us according to our iniquities.</p>
            <p><sup>11</sup> For as high as the heavens are above the earth, so great is his love for those who fear him;</p>
            <p><sup>12</sup> as far as the east is from the west, so far has he removed our transgressions from us.</p>
            <p><sup>13</sup> As a father has compassion on his children, so the Lord has compassion on those who fear him;</p>
            <p><sup>14</sup> for he knows how we are formed, he remembers that we are dust.</p>
            <p><sup>15</sup> The life of mortals is like grass, they flourish like a flower of the field;</p>
            <p><sup>16</sup> the wind blows over it and it is gone, and its place remembers it no more.</p>
            <p><sup>17</sup> But from everlasting to everlasting the Lord's love is with those who fear him, and his righteousness with their children’s children—</p>
            <p><sup>18</sup> with those who keep his covenant and remember to obey his precepts.</p>
            <p><sup>19</sup> The Lord has established his throne in heaven, and his kingdom rules over all.</p>
            <p><sup>20</sup> Praise the Lord, you his angels, you mighty ones who do his bidding, who obey his word.</p>
            <p><sup>21</sup> Praise the Lord, all his heavenly hosts, you his servants who do his will.</p>
            <p><sup>22</sup> Praise the Lord, all his works everywhere in his dominion. Praise the Lord, my soul.</p>
