            <p><sup>1</sup> He has founded his city on the holy mountain.</p>
            <p><sup>2</sup> The Lord loves the gates of Zion more than all the other dwellings of Jacob.</p>
            <p><sup>3</sup> Glorious things are said of you, city of God:</p>
            <p><sup>4</sup> “I will record Rahab and Babylon among those who acknowledge me— Philistia too, and Tyre, along with Cush— and will say, ‘This one was born in Zion.’”</p>
            <p><sup>5</sup> Indeed, of Zion it will be said, “This one and that one were born in her, and the Most High himself will establish her.”</p>
            <p><sup>6</sup> The Lord will write in the register of the peoples: “This one was born in Zion.”</p>
            <p><sup>7</sup> As they make music they will sing, “All my fountains are in you.”</p>
