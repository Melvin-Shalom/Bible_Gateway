            <p><sup>1</sup> Praise the Lord, my soul. Lord my God, you are very great; you are clothed with splendor and majesty.</p>
            <p><sup>2</sup> The Lord wraps himself in light as with a garment; he stretches out the heavens like a tent</p>
            <p><sup>3</sup> and lays the beams of his upper chambers on their waters. He makes the clouds his chariot and rides on the wings of the wind.</p>
            <p><sup>4</sup> He makes winds his messengers, flames of fire his servants.</p>
            <p><sup>5</sup> He set the earth on its foundations; it can never be moved.</p>
            <p><sup>6</sup> You covered it with the watery depths as with a garment; the waters stood above the mountains.</p>
            <p><sup>7</sup> But at your rebuke the waters fled, at the sound of your thunder they took to flight;</p>
            <p><sup>8</sup> they flowed over the mountains, they went down into the valleys, to the place you assigned for them.</p>
            <p><sup>9</sup> You set a boundary they cannot cross; never again will they cover the earth.</p>
            <p><sup>10</sup> He makes springs pour water into the ravines; it flows between the mountains.</p>
            <p><sup>11</sup> They give water to all the beasts of the field; the wild donkeys quench their thirst.</p>
            <p><sup>12</sup> The birds of the sky nest by the waters; they sing among the branches.</p>
            <p><sup>13</sup> He waters the mountains from his upper chambers; the land is satisfied by the fruit of his work.</p>
            <p><sup>14</sup> He makes grass grow for the cattle, and plants for people to cultivate— bringing forth food from the earth:</p>
            <p><sup>15</sup> wine that gladdens human hearts, oil to make their faces shine, and bread that sustains their hearts.</p>
            <p><sup>16</sup> The trees of the Lord are well watered, the cedars of Lebanon that he planted.</p>
            <p><sup>17</sup> There the birds make their nests; the stork has its home in the junipers.</p>
            <p><sup>18</sup> The high mountains belong to the wild goats; the crags are a refuge for the hyrax.</p>
            <p><sup>19</sup> He made the moon to mark the seasons, and the sun knows when to go down.</p>
            <p><sup>20</sup> You bring darkness, it becomes night, and all the beasts of the forest prowl.</p>
            <p><sup>21</sup> The lions roar for their prey and seek their food from God.</p>
            <p><sup>22</sup> The sun rises, and they steal away; they return and lie down in their dens.</p>
            <p><sup>23</sup> Then people go out to their work, to their labor until evening.</p>
            <p><sup>24</sup> How many are your works, Lord! In wisdom you made them all; the earth is full of your creatures.</p>
            <p><sup>25</sup> There is the sea, vast and spacious, teeming with creatures beyond number— living things both large and small.</p>
            <p><sup>26</sup> There the ships go to and fro, and Leviathan, which you formed to frolic there.</p>
            <p><sup>27</sup> All creatures look to you to give them their food at the proper time.</p>
            <p><sup>28</sup> When you give it to them, they gather it up; when you open your hand, they are satisfied with good things.</p>
            <p><sup>29</sup> When you hide your face, they are terrified; when you take away their breath, they die and return to the dust.</p>
            <p><sup>30</sup> When you send your Spirit, they are created, and you renew the face of the ground.</p>
            <p><sup>31</sup> May the glory of the Lord endure forever; may the Lord rejoice in his works—</p>
            <p><sup>32</sup> he who looks at the earth, and it trembles, who touches the mountains, and they smoke.</p>
            <p><sup>33</sup> I will sing to the Lord all my life; I will sing praise to my God as long as I live.</p>
            <p><sup>34</sup> May my meditation be pleasing to him, as I rejoice in the Lord.</p>
            <p><sup>35</sup> But may sinners vanish from the earth and the wicked be no more. Praise the Lord, my soul. Praise the Lord.</p>
