    <main>
        <div>
            <p><sup>1</sup> Praise the Lord. Praise the Lord, my soul.</p>
            <p><sup>2</sup> I will praise the Lord all my life; I will sing praise to my God as long as I live.</p>
            <p><sup>3</sup> Do not put your trust in princes, in human beings, who cannot save.</p>
            <p><sup>4</sup> When their spirit departs, they return to the ground; on that very day their plans come to nothing.</p>
            <p><sup>5</sup> Blessed are those whose help is the God of Jacob, whose hope is in the Lord their God.</p>
            <p><sup>6</sup> He is the Maker of heaven and earth, the sea, and everything in themâ€” he remains faithful forever.</p>
            <p><sup>7</sup> He upholds the cause of the oppressed and gives food to the hungry. The Lord sets prisoners free,</p>
            <p><sup>8</sup> the Lord gives sight to the blind, the Lord lifts up those who are bowed down, the Lord loves the righteous.</p>
            <p><sup>9</sup> The Lord watches over the foreigner and sustains the fatherless and the widow, but he frustrates the ways of the wicked.</p>
            <p><sup>10</sup> The Lord reigns forever, your God, O Zion, for all generations. Praise the Lord.</p>
