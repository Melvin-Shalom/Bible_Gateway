            <h4>For the director of music. A maskil of David. When Doeg the Edomite had gone to Saul and told him: “David has gone to the house of Ahimelek.”</h4>
            <p><sup>1</sup> Why do you boast of evil, you mighty hero? Why do you boast all day long, you who are a disgrace in the eyes of God?</p>
            <p><sup>2</sup> You who practice deceit, your tongue plots destruction; it is like a sharpened razor.</p>
            <p><sup>3</sup> You love evil rather than good, falsehood rather than speaking the truth.</p>
            <p><sup>4</sup> You love every harmful word, you deceitful tongue!</p>
            <p><sup>5</sup> Surely God will bring you down to everlasting ruin: He will snatch you up and pluck you from your tent; he will uproot you from the land of the living.</p>
            <p><sup>6</sup> The righteous will see and fear; they will laugh at you, saying,</p>
            <p><sup>7</sup> “Here now is the man who did not make God his stronghold but trusted in his great wealth and grew strong by destroying others!”</p>
            <p><sup>8</sup> But I am like an olive tree flourishing in the house of God; I trust in God’s unfailing love forever and ever.</p>
            <p><sup>9</sup> For what you have done I will always praise you in the presence of your faithful people. And I will hope in your name, for your name is good.</p>
