            <p><sup>1</sup> Masters, provide your slaves with what is right and fair, because you know that you also have a Master in heaven.</p>
    
            <h3>Further Instructions</h3>
            <p><sup>2</sup> Devote yourselves to prayer, being watchful and thankful.</p>
            <p><sup>3</sup> And pray for us, too, that God may open a door for our message, so that we may proclaim the mystery of Christ, for which I am in chains.</p>
            <p><sup>4</sup> Pray that I may proclaim it clearly, as I should.</p>
            <p><sup>5</sup> Be wise in the way you act toward outsiders; make the most of every opportunity.</p>
            <p><sup>6</sup> Let your conversation be always full of grace, seasoned with salt, so that you may know how to answer everyone.</p>

            <h3>Final Greetings</h3>
            <p><sup>7</sup> Tychicus will tell you all the news about me. He is a dear brother, a faithful minister and fellow servant in the Lord.</p>
            <p><sup>8</sup> I am sending him to you for the express purpose that you may know about our circumstances and that he may encourage your hearts.</p>
            <p><sup>9</sup> He is coming with Onesimus, our faithful and dear brother, who is one of you. They will tell you everything that is happening here.</p>
            <p><sup>10</sup> My fellow prisoner Aristarchus sends you his greetings, as does Mark, the cousin of Barnabas. (You have received instructions about him; if he comes to you, welcome him.)</p>
            <p><sup>11</sup> Jesus, who is called Justus, also sends greetings. These are the only Jews among my co-workers for the kingdom of God, and they have proved a comfort to me.</p>
            <p><sup>12</sup> Epaphras, who is one of you and a servant of Christ Jesus, sends greetings. He is always wrestling in prayer for you, that you may stand firm in all the will of God, mature and fully assured.</p>
            <p><sup>13</sup> I vouch for him that he is working hard for you and for those at Laodicea and Hierapolis.</p>
            <p><sup>14</sup> Our dear friend Luke, the doctor, and Demas send greetings.</p>
            <p><sup>15</sup> Give my greetings to the brothers and sisters at Laodicea, and to Nympha and the church in her house.</p>
            <p><sup>16</sup> After this letter has been read to you, see that it is also read in the church of the Laodiceans and that you in turn read the letter from Laodicea.</p>
            <p><sup>17</sup> Tell Archippus: “See to it that you complete the ministry you have received in the Lord.”</p>
            <p><sup>18</sup> I, Paul, write this greeting in my own hand. Remember my chains. Grace be with you.</p>
