            <h3>Favoritism Forbidden</h3>
            <p><sup>1</sup> My brothers and sisters, believers in our glorious Lord Jesus Christ must not show favoritism.</p>
            <p><sup>2</sup> Suppose a man comes into your meeting wearing a gold ring and fine clothes, and a poor man in filthy old clothes also comes in.</p>
            <p><sup>3</sup> If you show special attention to the man wearing fine clothes and say, “Here's a good seat for you,” but say to the poor man, “You stand there” or “Sit on the floor by my feet,”</p>
            <p><sup>4</sup> have you not discriminated among yourselves and become judges with evil thoughts?</p>
            <p><sup>5</sup> Listen, my dear brothers and sisters: Has not God chosen those who are poor in the eyes of the world to be rich in faith and to inherit the kingdom he promised those who love him?</p>
            <p><sup>6</sup> But you have dishonored the poor. Is it not the rich who are exploiting you? Are they not the ones who are dragging you into court?</p>
            <p><sup>7</sup> Are they not the ones who are blaspheming the noble name of him to whom you belong?</p>
            <p><sup>8</sup> If you really keep the royal law found in Scripture, “Love your neighbor as yourself,” you are doing right.</p>
            <p><sup>9</sup> But if you show favoritism, you sin and are convicted by the law as lawbreakers.</p>
            <p><sup>10</sup> For whoever keeps the whole law and yet stumbles at just one point is guilty of breaking all of it.</p>
            <p><sup>11</sup> For he who said, “You shall not commit adultery,” also said, “You shall not murder.” If you do not commit adultery but do commit murder, you have become a lawbreaker.</p>
            <p><sup>12</sup> Speak and act as those who are going to be judged by the law that gives freedom,</p>
            <p><sup>13</sup> because judgment without mercy will be shown to anyone who has not been merciful. Mercy triumphs over judgment.</p>
            <h3>Faith and Deeds</h3>
            <p><sup>14</sup> What good is it, my brothers and sisters, if someone claims to have faith but has no deeds? Can such faith save them?</p>
            <p><sup>15</sup> Suppose a brother or a sister is without clothes and daily food.</p>
            <p><sup>16</sup> If one of you says to them, “Go in peace; keep warm and well fed,” but does nothing about their physical needs, what good is it?</p>
            <p><sup>17</sup> In the same way, faith by itself, if it is not accompanied by action, is dead.</p>
            <p><sup>18</sup> But someone will say, “You have faith; I have deeds.” Show me your faith without deeds, and I will show you my faith by my deeds.</p>
            <p><sup>19</sup> You believe that there is one God. Good! Even the demons believe that—and shudder.</p>
            <p><sup>20</sup> You foolish person, do you want evidence that faith without deeds is useless?</p>
            <p><sup>21</sup> Was not our father Abraham considered righteous for what he did when he offered his son Isaac on the altar?</p>
            <p><sup>22</sup> You see that his faith and his actions were working together, and his faith was made complete by what he did.</p>
            <p><sup>23</sup> And the scripture was fulfilled that says, “Abraham believed God, and it was credited to him as righteousness,” and he was called God's friend.</p>
            <p><sup>24</sup> You see that a person is considered righteous by what they do and not by faith alone.</p>
            <p><sup>25</sup> In the same way, was not even Rahab the prostitute considered righteous for what she did when she gave lodging to the spies and sent them off in a different direction?</p>
            <p><sup>26</sup> As the body without the spirit is dead, so faith without deeds is dead.</p>
