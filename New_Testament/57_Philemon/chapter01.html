            <p><sup>1</sup> Paul, a prisoner of Christ Jesus, and Timothy our brother,</p>
            <p>To Philemon our dear friend and fellow worker—</p>
            <p><sup>2</sup> also to Apphia our sister and Archippus our fellow soldier—and to the church that meets in your home:</p>
            <p><sup>3</sup> Grace and peace to you from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.</p>
            <h3>Thanksgiving and Prayer</h3>
            <p><sup>4</sup> I always thank my God as I remember you in my prayers,</p>
            <p><sup>5</sup> because I hear about your love for all his holy people and your faith in the Lord Jesus.</p>
            <p><sup>6</sup> I pray that your partnership with us in the faith may be effective in deepening your understanding of every good thing we share for the sake of Christ.</p>
            <p><sup>7</sup> Your love has given me great joy and encouragement, because you, brother, have refreshed the hearts of the Lord's people.</p>
            <h3>Paul's Plea for Onesimus</h3>
            <p><sup>8</sup> Therefore, although in Christ I could be bold and order you to do what you ought to do,</p>
            <p><sup>9</sup> yet I prefer to appeal to you on the basis of love. It is as none other than Paul—an old man and now also a prisoner of Christ Jesus—</p>
            <p><sup>10</sup> that I appeal to you for my son Onesimus, who became my son while I was in chains.</p>
            <p><sup>11</sup> Formerly he was useless to you, but now he has become useful both to you and to me.</p>
            <p><sup>12</sup> I am sending him—who is my very heart—back to you.</p>
            <p><sup>13</sup> I would have liked to keep him with me so that he could take your place in helping me while I am in chains for the gospel.</p>
            <p><sup>14</sup> But I did not want to do anything without your consent, so that any favor you do would not seem forced but would be voluntary.</p>
            <p><sup>15</sup> Perhaps the reason he was separated from you for a little while was that you might have him back forever—</p>
            <p><sup>16</sup> no longer as a slave, but better than a slave, as a dear brother. He is very dear to me but even dearer to you, both as a fellow man and as a brother in the Lord.</p>
            <p><sup>17</sup> So if you consider me a partner, welcome him as you would welcome me.</p>
            <p><sup>18</sup> If he has done you any wrong or owes you anything, charge it to me.</p>
            <p><sup>19</sup> I, Paul, am writing this with my own hand. I will pay it back—not to mention that you owe me your very self.</p>
            <p><sup>20</sup> I do wish, brother, that I may have some benefit from you in the Lord; refresh my heart in Christ.</p>
            <p><sup>21</sup> Confident of your obedience, I write to you, knowing that you will do even more than I ask.</p>
            <p><sup>22</sup> And one thing more: Prepare a guest room for me, because I hope to be restored to you in answer to your prayers.</p>
            <p><sup>23</sup> Epaphras, my fellow prisoner in Christ Jesus, sends you greetings.</p>
            <p><sup>24</sup> And so do Mark, Aristarchus, Demas and Luke, my fellow workers.</p>
            <p><sup>25</sup> The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit.</p>
