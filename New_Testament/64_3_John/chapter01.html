            <p><sup>1</sup> The elder, To my dear friend Gaius, whom I love in the truth.</p>
            <p><sup>2</sup> Dear friend, I pray that you may enjoy good health and that all may go well with you, even
                as your soul is getting along well.</p>
            <p><sup>3</sup> It gave me great joy when some believers came and testified about your faithfulness to the
                truth, telling how you continue to walk in it.</p>
            <p><sup>4</sup> I have no greater joy than to hear that my children are walking in the truth.</p>
            <p><sup>5</sup> Dear friend, you are faithful in what you are doing for the brothers and sisters, even
                though they are strangers to you.</p>
            <p><sup>6</sup> They have told the church about your love. Please send them on their way in a manner that
                honors God.</p>
            <p><sup>7</sup> It was for the sake of the Name that they went out, receiving no help from the pagans.</p>
            <p><sup>8</sup> We ought therefore to show hospitality to such people so that we may work together for the
                truth.</p>
            <p><sup>9</sup> I wrote to the church, but Diotrephes, who loves to be first, will not welcome us.</p>
            <p><sup>10</sup> So when I come, I will call attention to what he is doing, spreading malicious nonsense
                about us. Not satisfied with that, he even refuses to welcome other believers. He also stops those who
                want to do so and puts them out of the church.</p>
            <p><sup>11</sup> Dear friend, do not imitate what is evil but what is good. Anyone who does what is good is
                from God. Anyone who does what is evil has not seen God.</p>
            <p><sup>12</sup> Demetrius is well spoken of by everyoneâ€”and even by the truth itself. We also speak well of
                him, and you know that our testimony is true.</p>
            <p><sup>13</sup> I have much to write you, but I do not want to do so with pen and ink.</p>
            <p><sup>14</sup> I hope to see you soon, and we will talk face to face.</p>
            <p><sup>15</sup> Peace to you. The friends here send their greetings. Greet the friends there by name.</p>
