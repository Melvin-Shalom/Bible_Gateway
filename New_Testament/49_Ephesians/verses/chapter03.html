            <h3>God’s Marvelous Plan for the Gentiles</h3>
            <p><sup>1</sup> For this reason I, Paul, the prisoner of Christ Jesus for the sake of you Gentiles—</p>
            <p><sup>2</sup> surely you have heard about the administration of God’s grace that was given to me for you,</p>
            <p><sup>3</sup> that is, the mystery made known to me by revelation, as I have already written briefly.</p>
            <p><sup>4</sup> In reading this, then, you will be able to understand my insight into the mystery of Christ,</p>
            <p><sup>5</sup> which was not made known to people in other generations as it has now been revealed by the Spirit to God’s holy apostles and prophets.</p>
            <p><sup>6</sup> This mystery is that through the gospel the Gentiles are heirs together with Israel, members together of one body, and sharers together in the promise in Christ Jesus.</p>
            <p><sup>7</sup> I became a servant of this gospel by the gift of God’s grace given me through the working of his power.</p>
            <p><sup>8</sup> Although I am less than the least of all the Lord’s people, this grace was given me: to preach to the Gentiles the boundless riches of Christ,</p>
            <p><sup>9</sup> and to make plain to everyone the administration of this mystery, which for ages past was kept hidden in God, who created all things.</p>
            <p><sup>10</sup> His intent was that now, through the church, the manifold wisdom of God should be made known to the rulers and authorities in the heavenly realms,</p>
            <p><sup>11</sup> according to his eternal purpose that he accomplished in Christ Jesus our Lord.</p>
            <p><sup>12</sup> In him and through faith in him we may approach God with freedom and confidence.</p>
            <p><sup>13</sup> I ask you, therefore, not to be discouraged because of my sufferings for you, which are your glory.</p>

            <h3>A Prayer for the Ephesians</h3>
            <p><sup>14</sup> For this reason I kneel before the Father,</p>
            <p><sup>15</sup> from whom every family in heaven and on earth derives its name.</p>
            <p><sup>16</sup> I pray that out of his glorious riches he may strengthen you with power through his Spirit in your inner being,</p>
            <p><sup>17</sup> so that Christ may dwell in your hearts through faith. And I pray that you, being rooted and established in love,</p>
            <p><sup>18</sup> may have power, together with all the Lord’s holy people, to grasp how wide and long and high and deep is the love of Christ,</p>
            <p><sup>19</sup> and to know this love that surpasses knowledge—that you may be filled to the measure of all the fullness of God.</p>
            <p><sup>20</sup> Now to him who is able to do immeasurably more than all we ask or imagine, according to his power that is at work within us,</p>
            <p><sup>21</sup> to him be glory in the church and in Christ Jesus throughout all generations, for ever and ever! Amen.</p>
