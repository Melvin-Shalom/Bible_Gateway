        <h1>Ephesians Chapter 5</h1>
    </header>
    <main>
        <div>
            <p><sup>1</sup> Follow God's example, therefore, as dearly loved children</p>
            <p><sup>2</sup> and walk in the way of love, just as Christ loved us and gave himself up for us as a fragrant offering and sacrifice to God.</p>
            <p><sup>3</sup> But among you there must not be even a hint of sexual immorality, or of any kind of impurity, or of greed, because these are improper for God's holy people.</p>
            <p><sup>4</sup> Nor should there be obscenity, foolish talk or coarse joking, which are out of place, but rather thanksgiving.</p>
            <p><sup>5</sup> For of this you can be sure: No immoral, impure or greedy person—such a person is an idolater—has any inheritance in the kingdom of Christ and of God.</p>
            <p><sup>6</sup> Let no one deceive you with empty words, for because of such things God's wrath comes on those who are disobedient.</p>
            <p><sup>7</sup> Therefore do not be partners with them.</p>
            <p><sup>8</sup> For you were once darkness, but now you are light in the Lord. Live as children of light</p>
            <p><sup>9</sup> (for the fruit of the light consists in all goodness, righteousness and truth)</p>
            <p><sup>10</sup> and find out what pleases the Lord.</p>
            <p><sup>11</sup> Have nothing to do with the fruitless deeds of darkness, but rather expose them.</p>
            <p><sup>12</sup> It is shameful even to mention what the disobedient do in secret.</p>
            <p><sup>13</sup> But everything exposed by the light becomes visible—and everything that is illuminated becomes a light.</p>
            <p><sup>14</sup> This is why it is said: “Wake up, sleeper, rise from the dead, and Christ will shine on you.”</p>
            <p><sup>15</sup> Be very careful, then, how you live—not as unwise but as wise,</p>
            <p><sup>16</sup> making the most of every opportunity, because the days are evil.</p>
            <p><sup>17</sup> Therefore do not be foolish, but understand what the Lord's will is.</p>
            <p><sup>18</sup> Do not get drunk on wine, which leads to debauchery. Instead, be filled with the Spirit,</p>
            <p><sup>19</sup> speaking to one another with psalms, hymns, and songs from the Spirit. Sing and make music from your heart to the Lord,</p>
            <p><sup>20</sup> always giving thanks to God the Father for everything, in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ.</p>

            <h3>Instructions for Christian Households</h3>
            <p><sup>21</sup> Submit to one another out of reverence for Christ.</p>
            <p><sup>22</sup> Wives, submit yourselves to your own husbands as you do to the Lord.</p>
            <p><sup>23</sup> For the husband is the head of the wife as Christ is the head of the church, his body, of which he is the Savior.</p>
            <p><sup>24</sup> Now as the church submits to Christ, so also wives should submit to their husbands in everything.</p>
            <p><sup>25</sup> Husbands, love your wives, just as Christ loved the church and gave himself up for her</p>
            <p><sup>26</sup> to make her holy, cleansing her by the washing with water through the word,</p>
            <p><sup>27</sup> and to present her to himself as a radiant church, without stain or wrinkle or any other blemish, but holy and blameless.</p>
            <p><sup>28</sup> In this same way, husbands ought to love their wives as their own bodies. He who loves his wife loves himself.</p>
            <p><sup>29</sup> After all, no one ever hated their own body, but they feed and care for their body, just as Christ does the church—</p>
            <p><sup>30</sup> for we are members of his body.</p>
            <p><sup>31</sup> “For this reason a man will leave his father and mother and be united to his wife, and the two will become one flesh.”</p>
            <p><sup>32</sup> This is a profound mystery—but I am talking about Christ and the church.</p>
            <p><sup>33</sup> However, each one of you also must love his wife as he loves himself, and the wife must respect her husband.</p>
