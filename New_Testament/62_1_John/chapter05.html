            <h3>Faith in the Incarnate Son of God</h3>
            <p><sup>1</sup> Everyone who believes that Jesus is the Christ is born of God, and everyone who loves the
                father loves his child as well.</p>
            <p><sup>2</sup> This is how we know that we love the children of God: by loving God and carrying out his
                commands.</p>
            <p><sup>3</sup> In fact, this is love for God: to keep his commands. And his commands are not burdensome,
            </p>
            <p><sup>4</sup> for everyone born of God overcomes the world. This is the victory that has overcome the
                world, even our faith.</p>
            <p><sup>5</sup> Who is it that overcomes the world? Only the one who believes that Jesus is the Son of God.
            </p>
            <p><sup>6</sup> This is the one who came by water and blood Jesus Christ. He did not come by water only, but
                by water and blood. And it is the Spirit who testifies, because the Spirit is the truth.</p>
            <p><sup>7</sup> For there are three that testify:</p>
            <p><sup>8</sup> the Spirit, the water and the blood; and the three are in agreement.</p>
            <p><sup>9</sup> We accept human testimony, but God's testimony is greater because it is the testimony of
                God, which he has given about his Son.</p>
            <p><sup>10</sup> Whoever believes in the Son of God accepts this testimony. Whoever does not believe God has
                made him out to be a liar, because they have not believed the testimony God has given about his Son.</p>
            <p><sup>11</sup> And this is the testimony: God has given us eternal life, and this life is in his Son.</p>
            <p><sup>12</sup> Whoever has the Son has life; whoever does not have the Son of God does not have life.</p>

            <h3>Concluding Affirmations</h3>
            <p><sup>13</sup> I write these things to you who believe in the name of the Son of God so that you may know
                that you have eternal life.</p>
            <p><sup>14</sup> This is the confidence we have in approaching God: that if we ask anything according to his
                will, he hears us.</p>
            <p><sup>15</sup> And if we know that he hears us whatever we ask we know that we have what we asked of him.
            </p>
            <p><sup>16</sup> If you see any brother or sister commit a sin that does not lead to death, you should pray
                and God will give them life. I refer to those whose sin does not lead to death. There is a sin that
                leads to death. I am not saying that you should pray about that.</p>
            <p><sup>17</sup> All wrongdoing is sin, and there is sin that does not lead to death.</p>
            <p><sup>18</sup> We know that anyone born of God does not continue to sin; the One who was born of God keeps
                them safe, and the evil one cannot harm them.</p>
            <p><sup>19</sup> We know that we are children of God, and that the whole world is under the control of the
                evil one.</p>
            <p><sup>20</sup> We know also that the Son of God has come and has given us understanding, so that we may
                know him who is true. And we are in him who is true by being in his Son Jesus Christ. He is the true God
                and eternal life.</p>
            <p><sup>21</sup> Dear children, keep yourselves from idols.</p>
