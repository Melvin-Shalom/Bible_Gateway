            <h3>Instructions on Worship</h3>
            <p><sup>1</sup> I urge, then, first of all, that petitions, prayers, intercession and thanksgiving be made for all people—</p>
            <p><sup>2</sup> for kings and all those in authority, that we may live peaceful and quiet lives in all godliness and holiness.</p>
            <p><sup>3</sup> This is good, and pleases God our Savior,</p>
            <p><sup>4</sup> who wants all people to be saved and to come to a knowledge of the truth.</p>
            <p><sup>5</sup> For there is one God and one mediator between God and mankind, the man Christ Jesus,</p>
            <p><sup>6</sup> who gave himself as a ransom for all people. This has now been witnessed to at the proper time.</p>
            <p><sup>7</sup> And for this purpose I was appointed a herald and an apostle—I am telling the truth, I am not lying—and a true and faithful teacher of the Gentiles.</p>
            <p><sup>8</sup> Therefore I want the men everywhere to pray, lifting up holy hands without anger or disputing.</p>
            <p><sup>9</sup> I also want the women to dress modestly, with decency and propriety, adorning themselves, not with elaborate hairstyles or gold or pearls or expensive clothes,</p>
            <p><sup>10</sup> but with good deeds, appropriate for women who profess to worship God.</p>
            <p><sup>11</sup> A woman should learn in quietness and full submission.</p>
            <p><sup>12</sup> I do not permit a woman to teach or to assume authority over a man; she must be quiet.</p>
            <p><sup>13</sup> For Adam was formed first, then Eve.</p>
            <p><sup>14</sup> And Adam was not the one deceived; it was the woman who was deceived and became a sinner.</p>
            <p><sup>15</sup> But women will be saved through childbearing—if they continue in faith, love and holiness with propriety.</p>
