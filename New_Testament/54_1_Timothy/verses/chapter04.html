            <h3>The Spirit Clearly Says</h3>
            <p><sup>1</sup> The Spirit clearly says that in later times some will abandon the faith and follow deceiving spirits and things taught by demons.</p>
            <p><sup>2</sup> Such teachings come through hypocritical liars, whose consciences have been seared as with a hot iron.</p>
            <p><sup>3</sup> They forbid people to marry and order them to abstain from certain foods, which God created to be received with thanksgiving by those who believe and who know the truth.</p>
            <p><sup>4</sup> For everything God created is good, and nothing is to be rejected if it is received with thanksgiving,</p>
            <p><sup>5</sup> because it is consecrated by the word of God and prayer.</p>
            
            <h3>A Good Minister's Discipline</h3>
            <p><sup>6</sup> If you point these things out to the brothers and sisters, you will be a good minister of Christ Jesus, nourished on the truths of the faith and of the good teaching that you have followed.</p>
            <p><sup>7</sup> Have nothing to do with godless myths and old wives' tales; rather, train yourself to be godly.</p>
            <p><sup>8</sup> For physical training is of some value, but godliness has value for all things, holding promise for both the present life and the life to come.</p>
            <p><sup>9</sup> This is a trustworthy saying that deserves full acceptance.</p>
            <p><sup>10</sup> That is why we labor and strive, because we have put our hope in the living God, who is the Savior of all people, and especially of those who believe.</p>
            
            <h3>Instructions to Timothy</h3>
            <p><sup>11</sup> Command and teach these things.</p>
            <p><sup>12</sup> Don't let anyone look down on you because you are young, but set an example for the believers in speech, in conduct, in love, in faith and in purity.</p>
            <p><sup>13</sup> Until I come, devote yourself to the public reading of Scripture, to preaching and to teaching.</p>
            <p><sup>14</sup> Do not neglect your gift, which was given you through prophecy when the body of elders laid their hands on you.</p>
            <p><sup>15</sup> Be diligent in these matters; give yourself wholly to them, so that everyone may see your progress.</p>
            <p><sup>16</sup> Watch your life and doctrine closely. Persevere in them, because if you do, you will save both yourself and your hearers.</p>
