            <h3>Qualifications for Overseers and Deacons</h3>
            <p><sup>1</sup> Here is a trustworthy saying: Whoever aspires to be an overseer desires a noble task.</p>
            <p><sup>2</sup> Now the overseer is to be above reproach, faithful to his wife, temperate, self-controlled, respectable, hospitable, able to teach,</p>
            <p><sup>3</sup> not given to drunkenness, not violent but gentle, not quarrelsome, not a lover of money.</p>
            <p><sup>4</sup> He must manage his own family well and see that his children obey him, and he must do so in a manner worthy of full respect.</p>
            <p><sup>5</sup> (If anyone does not know how to manage his own family, how can he take care of God's church?)</p>
            <p><sup>6</sup> He must not be a recent convert, or he may become conceited and fall under the same judgment as the devil.</p>
            <p><sup>7</sup> He must also have a good reputation with outsiders, so that he will not fall into disgrace and into the devil's trap.</p>
            <p><sup>8</sup> In the same way, deacons are to be worthy of respect, sincere, not indulging in much wine, and not pursuing dishonest gain.</p>
            <p><sup>9</sup> They must keep hold of the deep truths of the faith with a clear conscience.</p>
            <p><sup>10</sup> They must first be tested; and then if there is nothing against them, let them serve as deacons.</p>
            <p><sup>11</sup> In the same way, the women are to be worthy of respect, not malicious talkers but temperate and trustworthy in everything.</p>
            <p><sup>12</sup> A deacon must be faithful to his wife and must manage his children and his household well.</p>
            <p><sup>13</sup> Those who have served well gain an excellent standing and great assurance in their faith in Christ Jesus.</p>
            
            <h3>Reasons for Paul's Instructions</h3>
            <p><sup>14</sup> Although I hope to come to you soon, I am writing you these instructions so that,</p>
            <p><sup>15</sup> if I am delayed, you will know how people ought to conduct themselves in God's household, which is the church of the living God, the pillar and foundation of the truth.</p>
            <p><sup>16</sup> Beyond all question, the mystery from which true godliness springs is great:</p>
            <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He appeared in the flesh,<br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;was vindicated by the Spirit,<br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;was seen by angels,<br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;was preached among the nations,<br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;was believed on in the world,<br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;was taken up in glory.</p>
