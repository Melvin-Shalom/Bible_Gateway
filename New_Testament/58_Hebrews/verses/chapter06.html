            <p><sup>1</sup> Therefore let us move beyond the elementary teachings about Christ and be taken forward to
                maturity, not laying again the foundation of repentance from acts that lead to death, and of faith in
                God,
            </p>
            <p><sup>2</sup> instruction about cleansing rites, the laying on of hands, the resurrection of the dead, and
                eternal judgment.</p>
            <p><sup>3</sup> And God permitting, we will do so.</p>
            <p><sup>4</sup> It is impossible for those who have once been enlightened, who have tasted the heavenly
                gift,
                who have shared in the Holy Spirit,</p>
            <p><sup>5</sup> who have tasted the goodness of the word of God and the powers of the coming age</p>
            <p><sup>6</sup> and who have fallen away, to be brought back to repentance. To their loss they are
                crucifying
                the Son of God all over again and subjecting him to public disgrace.</p>
            <p><sup>7</sup> Land that drinks in the rain often falling on it and that produces a crop useful to those
                for
                whom it is farmed receives the blessing of God.</p>
            <p><sup>8</sup> But land that produces thorns and thistles is worthless and is in danger of being cursed. In
                the
                end it will be burned.</p>
            <p><sup>9</sup> Even though we speak like this, dear friends, we are convinced of better things in your
                case—the
                things that have to do with salvation.</p>
            <p><sup>10</sup> God is not unjust; he will not forget your work and the love you have shown him as you have
                helped his people and continue to help them.</p>
            <p><sup>11</sup> We want each of you to show this same diligence to the very end, so that what you hope for
                may
                be fully realized.</p>
            <p><sup>12</sup> We do not want you to become lazy, but to imitate those who through faith and patience
                inherit
                what has been promised.</p>
            <h3>The Certainty of God's Promise</h3>
            <p><sup>13</sup> When God made his promise to Abraham, since there was no one greater for him to swear by,
                he
                swore by himself,</p>
            <p><sup>14</sup> saying, “I will surely bless you and give you many descendants.”</p>
            <p><sup>15</sup> And so after waiting patiently, Abraham received what was promised.</p>
            <p><sup>16</sup> People swear by someone greater than themselves, and the oath confirms what is said and
                puts an
                end to all argument.</p>
            <p><sup>17</sup> Because God wanted to make the unchanging nature of his purpose very clear to the heirs of
                what
                was promised, he confirmed it with an oath.</p>
            <p><sup>18</sup> God did this so that, by two unchangeable things in which it is impossible for God to lie,
                we
                who have fled to take hold of the hope set before us may be greatly encouraged.</p>
            <p><sup>19</sup> We have this hope as an anchor for the soul, firm and secure. It enters the inner sanctuary
                behind the curtain,</p>
            <p><sup>20</sup> where our forerunner, Jesus, has entered on our behalf. He has become a high priest
                forever, in
                the order of Melchizedek.</p>
