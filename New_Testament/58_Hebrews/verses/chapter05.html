            <p><sup>1</sup> Every high priest is selected from among the people and is appointed to represent the people
                in
                matters related to God, to offer gifts and sacrifices for sins.</p>
            <p><sup>2</sup> He is able to deal gently with those who are ignorant and are going astray, since he himself
                is
                subject to weakness.</p>
            <p><sup>3</sup> This is why he has to offer sacrifices for his own sins, as well as for the sins of the
                people.
            </p>
            <p><sup>4</sup> And no one takes this honor on himself, but he receives it when called by God, just as Aaron
                was.</p>
            <p><sup>5</sup> In the same way, Christ did not take on himself the glory of becoming a high priest. But God
                said to him, “You are my Son; today I have become your Father.”</p>
            <p><sup>6</sup> And he says in another place, “You are a priest forever, in the order of Melchizedek.”</p>
            <p><sup>7</sup> During the days of Jesus' life on earth, he offered up prayers and petitions with fervent
                cries
                and tears to the one who could save him from death, and he was heard because of his reverent submission.
            </p>
            <p><sup>8</sup> Son though he was, he learned obedience from what he suffered</p>
            <p><sup>9</sup> and, once made perfect, he became the source of eternal salvation for all who obey him</p>
            <p><sup>10</sup> and was designated by God to be high priest in the order of Melchizedek.</p>
            <h3>Warning Against Falling Away</h3>
            <p><sup>11</sup> We have much to say about this, but it is hard to make it clear to you because you no
                longer
                try to understand.</p>
            <p><sup>12</sup> In fact, though by this time you ought to be teachers, you need someone to teach you the
                elementary truths of God’s word all over again. You need milk, not solid food!</p>
            <p><sup>13</sup> Anyone who lives on milk, being still an infant, is not acquainted with the teaching about
                righteousness.</p>
            <p><sup>14</sup> But solid food is for the mature, who by constant use have trained themselves to
                distinguish
                good from evil.</p>
