            <h3>Jesus Greater Than Moses</h3>
            <p><sup>1</sup> Therefore, holy brothers and sisters, who share in the heavenly calling, fix your thoughts
                on Jesus, whom we acknowledge as our apostle and high priest.</p>
            <p><sup>2</sup> He was faithful to the one who appointed him, just as Moses was faithful in all God's house.
            </p>
            <p><sup>3</sup> Jesus has been found worthy of greater honor than Moses, just as the builder of a house has
                greater honor than the house itself.</p>
            <p><sup>4</sup> For every house is built by someone, but God is the builder of everything.</p>
            <p><sup>5</sup> “Moses was faithful as a servant in all God's house,” bearing witness to what would be
                spoken by God in the future.</p>
            <p><sup>6</sup> But Christ is faithful as the Son over God's house. And we are his house, if indeed we hold
                firmly to our confidence and the hope in which we glory.</p>
            <h3>Warning Against Unbelief</h3>
            <p><sup>7</sup> So, as the Holy Spirit says: “Today, if you hear his voice,</p>
            <p><sup>8</sup> do not harden your hearts as you did in the rebellion, during the time of testing in the
                wilderness,</p>
            <p><sup>9</sup> where your ancestors tested and tried me, though for forty years they saw what I did.</p>
            <p><sup>10</sup> That is why I was angry with that generation; I said, 'Their hearts are always going
                astray, and they have not known my ways.'</p>
            <p><sup>11</sup> So I declared on oath in my anger, 'They shall never enter my rest.' ”</p>
            <p><sup>12</sup> See to it, brothers and sisters, that none of you has a sinful, unbelieving heart that
                turns away from the living God.</p>
            <p><sup>13</sup> But encourage one another daily, as long as it is called “Today,” so that none of you may
                be hardened by sin's deceitfulness.</p>
            <p><sup>14</sup> We have come to share in Christ, if indeed we hold our original conviction firmly to the
                very end.</p>
            <p><sup>15</sup> As has just been said: “Today, if you hear his voice, do not harden your hearts as you did
                in the rebellion.”</p>
            <p><sup>16</sup> Who were they who heard and rebelled? Were they not all those Moses led out of Egypt?</p>
            <p><sup>17</sup> And with whom was he angry for forty years? Was it not with those who sinned, whose bodies
                perished in the wilderness?</p>
            <p><sup>18</sup> And to whom did God swear that they would never enter his rest if not to those who
                disobeyed?</p>
            <p><sup>19</sup> So we see that they were not able to enter, because of their unbelief.</p>
