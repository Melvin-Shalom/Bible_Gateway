            <h3>The Day of the Lord</h3>
            <p><sup>1</sup> Now, brothers and sisters, about times and dates we do not need to write to you,</p>
            <p><sup>2</sup> for you know very well that the day of the Lord will come like a thief in the night.</p>
            <p><sup>3</sup> While people are saying, “Peace and safety,” destruction will come on them suddenly, as labor pains on a pregnant woman, and they will not escape.</p>
            <p><sup>4</sup> But you, brothers and sisters, are not in darkness so that this day should surprise you like a thief.</p>
            <p><sup>5</sup> You are all children of the light and children of the day. We do not belong to the night or to the darkness.</p>
            <p><sup>6</sup> So then, let us not be like others, who are asleep, but let us be awake and sober.</p>
            <p><sup>7</sup> For those who sleep, sleep at night, and those who get drunk, get drunk at night.</p>
            <p><sup>8</sup> But since we belong to the day, let us be sober, putting on faith and love as a breastplate, and the hope of salvation as a helmet.</p>
            <p><sup>9</sup> For God did not appoint us to suffer wrath but to receive salvation through our Lord Jesus Christ.</p>
            <p><sup>10</sup> He died for us so that, whether we are awake or asleep, we may live together with him.</p>
            <p><sup>11</sup> Therefore encourage one another and build each other up, just as in fact you are doing.</p>
    
            <h3>Final Instructions</h3>
            <p><sup>12</sup> Now we ask you, brothers and sisters, to acknowledge those who work hard among you, who care for you in the Lord and who admonish you.</p>
            <p><sup>13</sup> Hold them in the highest regard in love because of their work. Live in peace with each other.</p>
            <p><sup>14</sup> And we urge you, brothers and sisters, warn those who are idle and disruptive, encourage the disheartened, help the weak, be patient with everyone.</p>
            <p><sup>15</sup> Make sure that nobody pays back wrong for wrong, but always strive to do what is good for each other and for everyone else.</p>
            <p><sup>16</sup> Rejoice always,</p>
            <p><sup>17</sup> pray continually,</p>
            <p><sup>18</sup> give thanks in all circumstances; for this is God’s will for you in Christ Jesus.</p>
            <p><sup>19</sup> Do not quench the Spirit.</p>
            <p><sup>20</sup> Do not treat prophecies with contempt</p>
            <p><sup>21</sup> but test them all; hold on to what is good,</p>
            <p><sup>22</sup> reject every kind of evil.</p>
            <p><sup>23</sup> May God himself, the God of peace, sanctify you through and through. May your whole spirit, soul and body be kept blameless at the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ.</p>
            <p><sup>24</sup> The one who calls you is faithful, and he will do it.</p>
            <p><sup>25</sup> Brothers and sisters, pray for us.</p>
            <p><sup>26</sup> Greet all God’s people with a holy kiss.</p>
            <p><sup>27</sup> I charge you before the Lord to have this letter read to all the brothers and sisters.</p>
            <p><sup>28</sup> The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you.</p>
