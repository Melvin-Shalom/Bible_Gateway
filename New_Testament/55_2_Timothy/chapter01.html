            <h3>Thanksgiving</h3>
            <p><sup>1</sup> Paul, an apostle of Christ Jesus by the will of God, in keeping with the promise of life that is in Christ Jesus,</p>
            <p><sup>2</sup> To Timothy, my dear son: Grace, mercy and peace from God the Father and Christ Jesus our Lord.</p>
            <p><sup>3</sup> I thank God, whom I serve, as my ancestors did, with a clear conscience, as night and day I constantly remember you in my prayers.</p>
            <p><sup>4</sup> Recalling your tears, I long to see you, so that I may be filled with joy.</p>
            <p><sup>5</sup> I am reminded of your sincere faith, which first lived in your grandmother Lois and in your mother Eunice and, I am persuaded, now lives in you also.</p>
            
            <h3>Appeal for Loyalty to Paul and the Gospel</h3>
            <p><sup>6</sup> For this reason I remind you to fan into flame the gift of God, which is in you through the laying on of my hands.</p>
            <p><sup>7</sup> For the Spirit God gave us does not make us timid, but gives us power, love and self-discipline.</p>
            <p><sup>8</sup> So do not be ashamed of the testimony about our Lord or of me his prisoner. Rather, join with me in suffering for the gospel, by the power of God.</p>
            <p><sup>9</sup> He has saved us and called us to a holy life—not because of anything we have done but because of his own purpose and grace. This grace was given us in Christ Jesus before the beginning of time,</p>
            <p><sup>10</sup> but it has now been revealed through the appearing of our Savior, Christ Jesus, who has destroyed death and has brought life and immortality to light through the gospel.</p>
            <p><sup>11</sup> And of this gospel I was appointed a herald and an apostle and a teacher.</p>
            <p><sup>12</sup> That is why I am suffering as I am. Yet this is no cause for shame, because I know whom I have believed, and am convinced that he is able to guard what I have entrusted to him until that day.</p>
            <p><sup>13</sup> What you heard from me, keep as the pattern of sound teaching, with faith and love in Christ Jesus.</p>
            <p><sup>14</sup> Guard the good deposit that was entrusted to you—guard it with the help of the Holy Spirit who lives in us.</p>

            <h3>Examples of Disloyalty and Loyalty</h3>
            <p><sup>15</sup> You know that everyone in the province of Asia has deserted me, including Phygelus and Hermogenes.</p>
            <p><sup>16</sup> May the Lord show mercy to the household of Onesiphorus, because he often refreshed me and was not ashamed of my chains.</p>
            <p><sup>17</sup> On the contrary, when he was in Rome, he searched hard for me until he found me.</p>
            <p><sup>18</sup> May the Lord grant that he will find mercy from the Lord on that day! You know very well in how many ways he helped me in Ephesus.</p>
