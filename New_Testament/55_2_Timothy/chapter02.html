            <h3>The Appeal Renewed</h3>
            <p><sup>1</sup> You then, my son, be strong in the grace that is in Christ Jesus.</p>
            <p><sup>2</sup> And the things you have heard me say in the presence of many witnesses entrust to reliable people who will also be qualified to teach others.</p>
            <p><sup>3</sup> Join with me in suffering, like a good soldier of Christ Jesus.</p>
            <p><sup>4</sup> No one serving as a soldier gets entangled in civilian affairs, but rather tries to please his commanding officer.</p>
            <p><sup>5</sup> Similarly, anyone who competes as an athlete does not receive the victor’s crown except by competing according to the rules.</p>
            <p><sup>6</sup> The hardworking farmer should be the first to receive a share of the crops.</p>
            <p><sup>7</sup> Reflect on what I am saying, for the Lord will give you insight into all this.</p>
            <p><sup>8</sup> Remember Jesus Christ, raised from the dead, descended from David. This is my gospel,</p>
            <p><sup>9</sup> for which I am suffering even to the point of being chained like a criminal. But God’s word is not chained.</p>
            <p><sup>10</sup> Therefore I endure everything for the sake of the elect, that they too may obtain the salvation that is in Christ Jesus, with eternal glory.</p>
            <p><sup>11</sup> Here is a trustworthy saying:</p>
            <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If we died with him,<br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;we will also live with him;</p>
            <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>12</sup> if we endure,<br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;we will also reign with him.<br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If we disown him,<br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;he will also disown us;</p>
            <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>13</sup> if we are faithless,<br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;he remains faithful,<br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;for he cannot disown himself.</p>
            
            <h3>Dealing with False Teachers</h3>
            <p><sup>14</sup> Keep reminding God’s people of these things. Warn them before God against quarreling about words; it is of no value, and only ruins those who listen.</p>
            <p><sup>15</sup> Do your best to present yourself to God as one approved, a worker who does not need to be ashamed and who correctly handles the word of truth.</p>
            <p><sup>16</sup> Avoid godless chatter, because those who indulge in it will become more and more ungodly.</p>
            <p><sup>17</sup> Their teaching will spread like gangrene. Among them are Hymenaeus and Philetus,</p>
            <p><sup>18</sup> who have departed from the truth. They say that the resurrection has already taken place, and they destroy the faith of some.</p>
            <p><sup>19</sup> Nevertheless, God’s solid foundation stands firm, sealed with this inscription: “The Lord knows those who are his,” and, “Everyone who confesses the name of the Lord must turn away from wickedness.”</p>
            <p><sup>20</sup> In a large house there are articles not only of gold and silver, but also of wood and clay; some are for special purposes and some for common use.</p>
            <p><sup>21</sup> Those who cleanse themselves from the latter will be instruments for special purposes, made holy, useful to the Master and prepared to do any good work.</p>
            <p><sup>22</sup> Flee the evil desires of youth and pursue righteousness, faith, love and peace, along with those who call on the Lord out of a pure heart.</p>
            <p><sup>23</sup> Don’t have anything to do with foolish and stupid arguments, because you know they produce quarrels.</p>
            <p><sup>24</sup> And the Lord’s servant must not be quarrelsome but must be kind to everyone, able to teach, not resentful.</p>
            <p><sup>25</sup> Opponents must be gently instructed, in the hope that God will grant them repentance leading them to a knowledge of the truth,</p>
            <p><sup>26</sup> and that they will come to their senses and escape from the trap of the devil, who has taken them captive to do his will.</p>
