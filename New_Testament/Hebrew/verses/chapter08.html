        <h3>The High Priest of a New Covenant</h3>
        <p><sup>1</sup> Now the main point of what we are saying is this: We do have such a high priest, who sat down at
            the right hand of the throne of the Majesty in heaven,</p>
        <p><sup>2</sup> and who serves in the sanctuary, the true tabernacle set up by the Lord, not by a mere human
            being.</p>
        <p><sup>3</sup> Every high priest is appointed to offer both gifts and sacrifices, and so it was necessary for
            this one also to have something to offer.</p>
        <p><sup>4</sup> If he were on earth, he would not be a priest, for there are already priests who offer the gifts
            prescribed by the law.</p>
        <p><sup>5</sup> They serve at a sanctuary that is a copy and shadow of what is in heaven. This is why Moses was
            warned when he was about to build the tabernacle: “See to it that you make everything according to the
            pattern shown you on the mountain.”</p>
        <p><sup>6</sup> But in fact the ministry Jesus has received is as superior to theirs as the covenant of which he
            is mediator is superior to the old one, since the new covenant is established on better promises.</p>
        <p><sup>7</sup> For if there had been nothing wrong with that first covenant, no place would have been sought
            for another.</p>
        <p><sup>8</sup> But God found fault with the people and said: “The days are coming, declares the Lord, when I
            will make a new covenant with the people of
            Israel and with the people of Judah.</p>
        <p><sup>9</sup> It will not be like the covenant I made with their ancestors when I took them by the hand to
            lead them out of Egypt, because they did not remain faithful to my covenant, and I turned away from them,
            declares the Lord.</p>
        <p><sup>10</sup> This is the covenant I will establish with the people of Israel after that time, declares the
            Lord. I will put my laws in their minds and write them on their hearts. I will be their God, and they will
            be my people.</p>
        <p><sup>11</sup> No longer will they teach their neighbor, or say to one another, 'Know the Lord,'' because they
            will all know me, from the least of them to the greatest.</p>
        <p><sup>12</sup> For I will forgive their wickedness and will remember their sins no more.” </p>
        <p><sup>13</sup>By calling this covenant “new,” he has made the first one obsolete; and what is obsolete and
            outdated will soon disappear.
