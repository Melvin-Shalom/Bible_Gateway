            <h3>Imitating Christ’s Humility</h3>
            <p><sup>1</sup> Therefore, if you have any encouragement from being united with Christ, if any comfort from his love, if any common sharing in the Spirit, if any tenderness and compassion,</p>
            <p><sup>2</sup> then make my joy complete by being like-minded, having the same love, being one in spirit and of one mind.</p>
            <p><sup>3</sup> Do nothing out of selfish ambition or vain conceit. Rather, in humility value others above yourselves,</p>
            <p><sup>4</sup> not looking to your own interests but each of you to the interests of the others.</p>
            <p><sup>5</sup> In your relationships with one another, have the same mindset as Christ Jesus:</p>
            <p><sup>6</sup> Who, being in very nature God, did not consider equality with God something to be used to his own advantage;</p>
            <p><sup>7</sup> rather, he made himself nothing by taking the very nature of a servant, being made in human likeness.</p>
            <p><sup>8</sup> And being found in appearance as a man, he humbled himself by becoming obedient to death— even death on a cross!</p>
            <p><sup>9</sup> Therefore God exalted him to the highest place and gave him the name that is above every name,</p>
            <p><sup>10</sup> that at the name of Jesus every knee should bow, in heaven and on earth and under the earth,</p>
            <p><sup>11</sup> and every tongue acknowledge that Jesus Christ is Lord, to the glory of God the Father.</p>

            <h3>Do Everything Without Grumbling</h3>
            <p><sup>12</sup> Therefore, my dear friends, as you have always obeyed—not only in my presence, but now much more in my absence—continue to work out your salvation with fear and trembling,</p>
            <p><sup>13</sup> for it is God who works in you to will and to act in order to fulfill his good purpose.</p>
            <p><sup>14</sup> Do everything without grumbling or arguing,</p>
            <p><sup>15</sup> so that you may become blameless and pure, “children of God without fault in a warped and crooked generation.” Then you will shine among them like stars in the sky</p>
            <p><sup>16</sup> as you hold firmly to the word of life. And then I will be able to boast on the day of Christ that I did not run or labor in vain.</p>
            <p><sup>17</sup> But even if I am being poured out like a drink offering on the sacrifice and service coming from your faith, I am glad and rejoice with all of you.</p>
            <p><sup>18</sup> So you too should be glad and rejoice with me.</p>

            <h3>Timothy and Epaphroditus</h3>
            <p><sup>19</sup> I hope in the Lord Jesus to send Timothy to you soon, that I also may be cheered when I receive news about you.</p>
            <p><sup>20</sup> I have no one else like him, who will show genuine concern for your welfare.</p>
            <p><sup>21</sup> For everyone looks out for their own interests, not those of Jesus Christ.</p>
            <p><sup>22</sup> But you know that Timothy has proved himself, because as a son with his father he has served with me in the work of the gospel.</p>
            <p><sup>23</sup> I hope, therefore, to send him as soon as I see how things go with me.</p>
            <p><sup>24</sup> And I am confident in the Lord that I myself will come soon.</p>
            <p><sup>25</sup> But I think it is necessary to send back to you Epaphroditus, my brother, co-worker and fellow soldier, who is also your messenger, whom you sent to take care of my needs.</p>
            <p><sup>26</sup> For he longs for all of you and is distressed because you heard he was ill.</p>
            <p><sup>27</sup> Indeed he was ill, and almost died. But God had mercy on him, and not on him only but also on me, to spare me sorrow upon sorrow.</p>
            <p><sup>28</sup> Therefore I am all the more eager to send him, so that when you see him again you may be glad and I may have less anxiety.</p>
            <p><sup>29</sup> So then, welcome him in the Lord with great joy, and honor people like him,</p>
            <p><sup>30</sup> because he almost died for the work of Christ. He risked his life to make up for the help you yourselves could not give me.</p>
