            <p><sup>1</sup> Paul and Timothy, servants of Christ Jesus,</p>
            <p><sup>2</sup> To all God's holy people in Christ Jesus at Philippi, together with the overseers and deacons:</p>

            <h3>Thanksgiving and Prayer</h3>
            <p><sup>3</sup> Grace and peace to you from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.</p>
            <p><sup>4</sup> I thank my God every time I remember you.</p>
            <p><sup>5</sup> In all my prayers for all of you, I always pray with joy</p>
            <p><sup>6</sup> because of your partnership in the gospel from the first day until now,</p>
            <p><sup>7</sup> being confident of this, that he who began a good work in you will carry it on to completion until the day of Christ Jesus.</p>
            <p><sup>8</sup> It is right for me to feel this way about all of you, since I have you in my heart and, whether I am in chains or defending and confirming the gospel, all of you share in God's grace with me.</p>
            <p><sup>9</sup> God can testify how I long for all of you with the affection of Christ Jesus.</p>
            <p><sup>10</sup> And this is my prayer: that your love may abound more and more in knowledge and depth of insight,</p>
            <p><sup>11</sup> so that you may be able to discern what is best and may be pure and blameless for the day of Christ,</p>

            <h3>Paul's Chains Advance the Gospel</h3>
            <p><sup>12</sup> filled with the fruit of righteousness that comes through Jesus Christ—to the glory and praise of God.</p>
            <p><sup>13</sup> Now I want you to know, brothers and sisters, that what has happened to me has actually served to advance the gospel.</p>
            <p><sup>14</sup> As a result, it has become clear throughout the whole palace guard and to everyone else that I am in chains for Christ.</p>
            <p><sup>15</sup> And because of my chains, most of the brothers and sisters have become confident in the Lord and dare all the more to proclaim the gospel without fear.</p>
            <p><sup>16</sup> It is true that some preach Christ out of envy and rivalry, but others out of goodwill.</p>
            <p><sup>17</sup> The latter do so out of love, knowing that I am put here for the defense of the gospel.</p>
            <p><sup>18</sup> The former preach Christ out of selfish ambition, not sincerely, supposing that they can stir up trouble for me while I am in chains.</p>
            <p><sup>19</sup> But what does it matter? The important thing is that in every way, whether from false motives or true, Christ is preached. And because of this I rejoice.</p>
            <p><sup>20</sup> Yes, and I will continue to rejoice,</p>
            <p><sup>21</sup> for I know that through your prayers and God's provision of the Spirit of Jesus Christ what has happened to me will turn out for my deliverance.</p>
            <p><sup>22</sup> I eagerly expect and hope that I will in no way be ashamed, but will have sufficient courage so that now as always Christ will be exalted in my body, whether by life or by death.</p>
            <p><sup>23</sup> For to me, to live is Christ and to die is gain.</p>
            <p><sup>24</sup> If I am to go on living in the body, this will mean fruitful labor for me. Yet what shall I choose? I do not know!</p>
            <p><sup>25</sup> I am torn between the two: I desire to depart and be with Christ, which is better by far;</p>
            <p><sup>26</sup> but it is more necessary for you that I remain in the body.</p>
            <p><sup>27</sup> Convinced of this, I know that I will remain, and I will continue with all of you for your progress and joy in the faith,</p>

            <h3>Final Exhortations</h3>
            <p><sup>28</sup> so that through my being with you again your boasting in Christ Jesus will abound on account of me.</p>
            <p><sup>29</sup> Whatever happens, conduct yourselves in a manner worthy of the gospel of Christ. Then, whether I come and see you or only hear about you in my absence, I will know that you stand firm in the one Spirit, striving together as one for the faith of the gospel</p>
            <p><sup>30</sup> without being frightened in any way by those who oppose you. This is a sign to them that they will be destroyed, but that you will be saved—and that by God.</p>
