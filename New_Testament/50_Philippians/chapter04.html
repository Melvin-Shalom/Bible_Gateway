            <h3>Closing Appeal for Steadfastness and Unity</h3>
            <p><sup>1</sup> Therefore, my brothers and sisters, you whom I love and long for, my joy and crown, stand firm in the Lord in this way, dear friends!</p>
            <p><sup>2</sup> I plead with Euodia and I plead with Syntyche to be of the same mind in the Lord.</p>
            <p><sup>3</sup> Yes, and I ask you, my true companion, help these women since they have contended at my side in the cause of the gospel, along with Clement and the rest of my co-workers, whose names are in the book of life.</p>

            <h3>Final Exhortations</h3>
            <p><sup>4</sup> Rejoice in the Lord always. I will say it again: Rejoice!</p>
            <p><sup>5</sup> Let your gentleness be evident to all. The Lord is near.</p>
            <p><sup>6</sup> Do not be anxious about anything, but in every situation, by prayer and petition, with thanksgiving, present your requests to God.</p>
            <p><sup>7</sup> And the peace of God, which transcends all understanding, will guard your hearts and your minds in Christ Jesus.</p>
            <p><sup>8</sup> Finally, brothers and sisters, whatever is true, whatever is noble, whatever is right, whatever is pure, whatever is lovely, whatever is admirable—if anything is excellent or praiseworthy—think about such things.</p>
            <p><sup>9</sup> Whatever you have learned or received or heard from me, or seen in me—put it into practice. And the God of peace will be with you.</p>

            <h3>Thanks for Their Gifts</h3>
            <p><sup>10</sup> I rejoiced greatly in the Lord that at last you renewed your concern for me. Indeed, you were concerned, but you had no opportunity to show it.</p>
            <p><sup>11</sup> I am not saying this because I am in need, for I have learned to be content whatever the circumstances.</p>
            <p><sup>12</sup> I know what it is to be in need, and I know what it is to have plenty. I have learned the secret of being content in any and every situation, whether well fed or hungry, whether living in plenty or in want.</p>
            <p><sup>13</sup> I can do all this through him who gives me strength.</p>
            <p><sup>14</sup> Yet it was good of you to share in my troubles.</p>
            <p><sup>15</sup> Moreover, as you Philippians know, in the early days of your acquaintance with the gospel, when I set out from Macedonia, not one church shared with me in the matter of giving and receiving, except you only;</p>
            <p><sup>16</sup> for even when I was in Thessalonica, you sent me aid more than once when I was in need.</p>
            <p><sup>17</sup> Not that I desire your gifts; what I desire is that more be credited to your account.</p>
            <p><sup>18</sup> I have received full payment and have more than enough. I am amply supplied, now that I have received from Epaphroditus the gifts you sent. They are a fragrant offering, an acceptable sacrifice, pleasing to God.</p>
            <p><sup>19</sup> And my God will meet all your needs according to the riches of his glory in Christ Jesus.</p>
            <p><sup>20</sup> To our God and Father be glory for ever and ever. Amen.</p>
            <p><sup>21</sup> Greet all God’s people in Christ Jesus. The brothers and sisters who are with me send greetings.</p>
            <p><sup>22</sup> All God’s people here send you greetings, especially those who belong to Caesar’s household.</p>
            <p><sup>23</sup> The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit. Amen.</p>
