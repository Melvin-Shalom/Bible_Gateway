            <h3>No Confidence in the Flesh</h3>
            <p><sup>1</sup> Finally, my brothers and sisters, rejoice in the Lord! It is no trouble for me to write the same things to you again, and it is a safeguard for you.</p>
            <p><sup>2</sup> Watch out for those dogs, those evildoers, those mutilators of the flesh.</p>
            <p><sup>3</sup> For it is we who are the circumcision, we who serve God by his Spirit, who boast in Christ Jesus, and who put no confidence in the flesh—</p>
            <p><sup>4</sup> though I myself have reasons for such confidence.</p>
            <p><sup>5</sup> If someone else thinks they have reasons to put confidence in the flesh, I have more:</p>
            <p><sup>6</sup> circumcised on the eighth day, of the people of Israel, of the tribe of Benjamin, a Hebrew of Hebrews; in regard to the law, a Pharisee;</p>
            <p><sup>7</sup> as for zeal, persecuting the church; as for righteousness based on the law, faultless.</p>
            <p><sup>8</sup> But whatever were gains to me I now consider loss for the sake of Christ.</p>
            <p><sup>9</sup> What is more, I consider everything a loss because of the surpassing worth of knowing Christ Jesus my Lord, for whose sake I have lost all things. I consider them garbage, that I may gain Christ</p>
            <p><sup>10</sup> and be found in him, not having a righteousness of my own that comes from the law, but that which is through faith in Christ—the righteousness that comes from God on the basis of faith.</p>
            <p><sup>11</sup> I want to know Christ—yes, to know the power of his resurrection and participation in his sufferings, becoming like him in his death,</p>
            <p><sup>12</sup> and so, somehow, attaining to the resurrection from the dead.</p>
            <p><sup>13</sup> Brothers and sisters, I do not consider myself yet to have taken hold of it. But one thing I do: Forgetting what is behind and straining toward what is ahead,</p>
            <p><sup>14</sup> I press on toward the goal to win the prize for which God has called me heavenward in Christ Jesus.</p>

            <h3>Following Paul’s Example</h3>
            <p><sup>15</sup> All of us, then, who are mature should take such a view of things. And if on some point you think differently, that too God will make clear to you.</p>
            <p><sup>16</sup> Only let us live up to what we have already attained.</p>
            <p><sup>17</sup> Join together in following my example, brothers and sisters, and just as you have us as a model, keep your eyes on those who live as we do.</p>
            <p><sup>18</sup> For, as I have often told you before and now tell you again even with tears, many live as enemies of the cross of Christ.</p>
            <p><sup>19</sup> Their destiny is destruction, their god is their stomach, and their glory is in their shame. Their mind is set on earthly things.</p>
            <p><sup>20</sup> But our citizenship is in heaven. And we eagerly await a Savior from there, the Lord Jesus Christ,</p>
            <p><sup>21</sup> who, by the power that enables him to bring everything under his control, will transform our lowly bodies so that they will be like his glorious body.</p>
