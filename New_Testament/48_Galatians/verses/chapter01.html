        <div>
            <p><sup>1</sup> Paul, an apostle—sent not from men nor by a man, but by Jesus Christ and God the Father, who raised him from the dead—</p>
            <p><sup>2</sup> and all the brothers and sisters with me, To the churches in Galatia:</p>
            <p><sup>3</sup> Grace and peace to you from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ,</p>
            <p><sup>4</sup> who gave himself for our sins to rescue us from the present evil age, according to the will of our God and Father,</p>
            <p><sup>5</sup> to whom be glory for ever and ever. Amen.</p>
    
            <h3>No Other Gospel</h3>
            <p><sup>6</sup> I am astonished that you are so quickly deserting the one who called you to live in the grace of Christ and are turning to a different gospel—</p>
            <p><sup>7</sup> which is really no gospel at all. Evidently some people are throwing you into confusion and are trying to pervert the gospel of Christ.</p>
            <p><sup>8</sup> But even if we or an angel from heaven should preach a gospel other than the one we preached to you, let them be under God’s curse!</p>
            <p><sup>9</sup> As we have already said, so now I say again: If anybody is preaching to you a gospel other than what you accepted, let them be under God’s curse!</p>
            <p><sup>10</sup> Am I now trying to win the approval of human beings, or of God? Or am I trying to please people? If I were still trying to please people, I would not be a servant of Christ.</p>
    
            <h3>Paul Called by God</h3>
            <p><sup>11</sup> I want you to know, brothers and sisters, that the gospel I preached is not of human origin.</p>
            <p><sup>12</sup> I did not receive it from any man, nor was I taught it; rather, I received it by revelation from Jesus Christ.</p>
            <p><sup>13</sup> For you have heard of my previous way of life in Judaism, how intensely I persecuted the church of God and tried to destroy it.</p>
            <p><sup>14</sup> I was advancing in Judaism beyond many of my own age among my people and was extremely zealous for the traditions of my fathers.</p>
            <p><sup>15</sup> But when God, who set me apart from my mother’s womb and called me by his grace, was pleased</p>
            <p><sup>16</sup> to reveal his Son in me so that I might preach him among the Gentiles, my immediate response was not to consult any human being.</p>
            <p><sup>17</sup> I did not go up to Jerusalem to see those who were apostles before I was, but I went into Arabia. Later I returned to Damascus.</p>
            <p><sup>18</sup> Then after three years, I went up to Jerusalem to get acquainted with Cephas and stayed with him fifteen days.</p>
            <p><sup>19</sup> I saw none of the other apostles—only James, the Lord’s brother.</p>
            <p><sup>20</sup> I assure you before God that what I am writing you is no lie.</p>
            <p><sup>21</sup> Then I went to Syria and Cilicia.</p>
            <p><sup>22</sup> I was personally unknown to the churches of Judea that are in Christ.</p>
            <p><sup>23</sup> They only heard the report: “The man who formerly persecuted us is now preaching the faith he once tried to destroy.”</p>
            <p><sup>24</sup> And they praised God because of me.</p>
