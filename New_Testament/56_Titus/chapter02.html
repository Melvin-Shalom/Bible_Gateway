            <h3>Doing Good for the Sake of the Gospel</h3>
            <p><sup>1</sup> You, however, must teach what is appropriate to sound doctrine.</p>
            <p><sup>2</sup> Teach the older men to be temperate, worthy of respect, self-controlled, and sound in faith, in love and in endurance.</p>
            <p><sup>3</sup> Likewise, teach the older women to be reverent in the way they live, not to be slanderers or addicted to much wine, but to teach what is good.</p>
            <p><sup>4</sup> Then they can urge the younger women to love their husbands and children,</p>
            <p><sup>5</sup> to be self-controlled and pure, to be busy at home, to be kind, and to be subject to their husbands, so that no one will malign the word of God.</p>
            <p><sup>6</sup> Similarly, encourage the young men to be self-controlled.</p>
            <p><sup>7</sup> In everything set them an example by doing what is good. In your teaching show integrity, seriousness</p>
            <p><sup>8</sup> and soundness of speech that cannot be condemned, so that those who oppose you may be ashamed because they have nothing bad to say about us.</p>
            <p><sup>9</sup> Teach slaves to be subject to their masters in everything, to try to please them, not to talk back to them,</p>
            <p><sup>10</sup> and not to steal from them, but to show that they can be fully trusted, so that in every way they will make the teaching about God our Savior attractive.</p>
            <p><sup>11</sup> For the grace of God has appeared that offers salvation to all people.</p>
            <p><sup>12</sup> It teaches us to say “No” to ungodliness and worldly passions, and to live self-controlled, upright and godly lives in this present age,</p>
            <p><sup>13</sup> while we wait for the blessed hope—the appearing of the glory of our great God and Savior, Jesus Christ,</p>
            <p><sup>14</sup> who gave himself for us to redeem us from all wickedness and to purify for himself a people that are his very own, eager to do what is good.</p>
            <p><sup>15</sup> These, then, are the things you should teach. Encourage and rebuke with all authority. Do not let anyone despise you.</p>
