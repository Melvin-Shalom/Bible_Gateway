            <h3>Paul's Greeting to Titus</h3>
            <p><sup>1</sup> Paul, a servant of God and an apostle of Jesus Christ to further the faith of God's elect and their knowledge of the truth that leads to godliness—</p>
            <p><sup>2</sup> in the hope of eternal life, which God, who does not lie, promised before the beginning of time,</p>
            <p><sup>3</sup> and which now at his appointed season he has brought to light through the preaching entrusted to me by the command of God our Savior,</p>
            <p><sup>4</sup> To Titus, my true son in our common faith: Grace and peace from God the Father and Christ Jesus our Savior.</p>
            
            <h3>Appointing Elders Who Love What Is Good</h3>
            <p><sup>5</sup> The reason I left you in Crete was that you might put in order what was left unfinished and appoint elders in every town, as I directed you.</p>
            <p><sup>6</sup> An elder must be blameless, faithful to his wife, a man whose children believe and are not open to the charge of being wild and disobedient.</p>
            <p><sup>7</sup> Since an overseer manages God's household, he must be blameless—not overbearing, not quick-tempered, not given to drunkenness, not violent, not pursuing dishonest gain.</p>
            <p><sup>8</sup> Rather, he must be hospitable, one who loves what is good, who is self-controlled, upright, holy and disciplined.</p>
            <p><sup>9</sup> He must hold firmly to the trustworthy message as it has been taught, so that he can encourage others by sound doctrine and refute those who oppose it.</p>
            
            <h3>Rebuking Those Who Fail to Do Good</h3>
            <p><sup>10</sup> For there are many rebellious people, full of meaningless talk and deception, especially those of the circumcision group.</p>
            <p><sup>11</sup> They must be silenced, because they are disrupting whole households by teaching things they ought not to teach—and that for the sake of dishonest gain.</p>
            <p><sup>12</sup> One of Crete's own prophets has said it: “Cretans are always liars, evil brutes, lazy gluttons.”</p>
            <p><sup>13</sup> This saying is true. Therefore rebuke them sharply, so that they will be sound in the faith</p>
            <p><sup>14</sup> and will pay no attention to Jewish myths or to the merely human commands of those who reject the truth.</p>
            <p><sup>15</sup> To the pure, all things are pure, but to those who are corrupted and do not believe, nothing is pure. In fact, both their minds and consciences are corrupted.</p>
            <p><sup>16</sup> They claim to know God, but by their actions they deny him. They are detestable, disobedient and unfit for doing anything good.</p>
