        <h1>1 Peter Chapter 2</h1>
    </header>
    <main>
        <div>
            <p><sup>1</sup> Therefore, rid yourselves of all malice and all deceit, hypocrisy, envy, and slander of every kind.</p>
            <p><sup>2</sup> Like newborn babies, crave pure spiritual milk, so that by it you may grow up in your salvation,</p>
            <p><sup>3</sup> now that you have tasted that the Lord is good.</p>

            <h3>The Living Stone and a Chosen People</h3>
            <p><sup>4</sup> As you come to him, the living Stone—rejected by humans but chosen by God and precious to him—</p>
            <p><sup>5</sup> you also, like living stones, are being built into a spiritual house to be a holy priesthood, offering spiritual sacrifices acceptable to God through Jesus Christ. “See, I lay a stone in Zion, a chosen and precious cornerstone, and the one who trusts in him will never be put to shame.”</p>
            <p><sup>7</sup> Now to you who believe, this stone is precious. But to those who do not believe, “The stone the builders rejected has become the cornerstone,”</p>
            <p><sup>8</sup> and, “A stone that causes people to stumble and a rock that makes them fall.” They stumble because they disobey the message—which is also what they were destined for.</p>
            <p><sup>9</sup> But you are a chosen people, a royal priesthood, a holy nation, God’s special possession, that you may declare the praises of him who called you out of darkness into his wonderful light.</p>
            <p><sup>10</sup> Once you were not a people, but now you are the people of God; once you had not received mercy, but now you have received mercy.</p>
    
            <h3>Living Godly Lives in a Pagan Society</h3>
            <p><sup>11</sup> Dear friends, I urge you, as foreigners and exiles, to abstain from sinful desires, which wage war against your soul.</p>
            <p><sup>12</sup> Live such good lives among the pagans that, though they accuse you of doing wrong, they may see your good deeds and glorify God on the day he visits us.</p>
            <p><sup>13</sup> Submit yourselves for the Lord’s sake to every human authority: whether to the emperor, as the supreme authority,</p>
            <p><sup>14</sup> or to governors, who are sent by him to punish those who do wrong and to commend those who do right.</p>
            <p><sup>15</sup> For it is God’s will that by doing good you should silence the ignorant talk of foolish people.</p>
            <p><sup>16</sup> Live as free people, but do not use your freedom as a cover-up for evil; live as God’s slaves.</p>
            <p><sup>17</sup> Show proper respect to everyone, love the family of believers, fear God, honor the emperor.</p>
            <p><sup>18</sup> Slaves, in reverent fear of God submit yourselves to your masters, not only to those who are good and considerate, but also to those who are harsh.</p>
            <p><sup>19</sup> For it is commendable if someone bears up under the pain of unjust suffering because they are conscious of God.</p>
            <p><sup>20</sup> But how is it to your credit if you receive a beating for doing wrong and endure it? But if you suffer for doing good and you endure it, this is commendable before God.</p>
            <p><sup>21</sup> To this you were called, because Christ suffered for you, leaving you an example, that you should follow in his steps.</p>
            <p><sup>22</sup> “He committed no sin, and no deceit was found in his mouth.”</p>
            <p><sup>23</sup> When they hurled their insults at him, he did not retaliate; when he suffered, he made no threats. Instead, he entrusted himself to him who judges justly.</p>
            <p><sup>24</sup> “He himself bore our sins” in his body on the cross, so that we might die to sins and live for righteousness; “by his wounds you have been healed.”</p>
            <p><sup>25</sup> For “you were like sheep going astray,” but now you have returned to the Shepherd and Overseer of your souls.</p>
