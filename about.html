        <p class="text-center">The "Covenant Bible" implies a compilation of sacred scriptures that emphasizes the
            promises and agreements made by God throughout biblical history. It suggests a focus on the relational
            aspect of faith, highlighting the importance of God's commitments to His people and their responses to Him.
            This title can resonate deeply with readers who appreciate the concept of divine promises and the ongoing
            relationship between God and humanity.</p>

        <p class="text-center">Furthermore, the "Covenant Bible" serves as a modern reinterpretation of the New
            International Version (NIV) translation, retaining the essence of its message while making it accessible and
            engaging for contemporary audiences.</p>

        <p class="text-center">As a developer student project, this initiative not only allows for a deep dive into
            biblical texts but also provides a platform to showcase my technical skills in web development. Through this
            project, I aim to create a user-friendly interface that encourages exploration of scripture while ensuring
            that the richness of the original NIV translation is preserved and enhanced.</p>
